            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O Pardon the Presumption of sending abroad the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Papers under the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage of your Name. Not that by the advantage of your Graces Authority I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to cover any Mistakes or Failures that are in them; or that I think any Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, how great soever, can protect even the most usefull and innocent Undertaking from the Censures of the Envious and the Malicious: But that I should esteem it a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Honour and Privilege to have them own'd by a Person, who by his excellent Learning is as able, as by his Place he is oblig'd to defend those Great <hi>Catholic</hi> and <hi>Apostolic</hi> Truths, whose hard lot and por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is Historically represented in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<pb facs="tcp:49523:3"/> Book. The Doctrines, I mean, of the holy and undivided Trinity, and the Divinity of our blessed Saviour, together with the appendant Articles, so vigorously persecuted in the Age we write of, and now again oppos'd in the Age we live in.</p>
            <p>Nor is this the only instance, wherein the Church needs your Graces Learning, and wise Conduct; no less now, than it did that of <hi>Athanasius, Basil,</hi> or <hi>Ambrose</hi> of old. Our Times, like theirs, are troublesom and unquiet, full of disorder and distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction on every side. The common Laws of Charity are broken down; and Religion, in it self the strongest Principle of Peace and Unity, is made the Instrument of Feud and Faction, and of a bitter and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate Zeal. The Church of <hi>England,</hi> incomperably the best Part of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Church at this day visible upon Earth, is miserably torn in pieces, hated and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligned; secretly undermin'd by Enemies from abroad, and openly assaulted by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Friends at home. <hi>Altar</hi> is erected against <hi>Altar,</hi> and private Congregations kept up in opposition to the publick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions. Her Liturgy and Forms of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Administration derided, odiously tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd, and run down with nothing but Noise and Clamour. Her Rites and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions, though the same that were used in the Primitive Ages of Christianity, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cried as Antichristian. Her Discipline and
<pb facs="tcp:49523:3"/> Authority weakned, and by the obstina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and perverseness of Men made inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual. The small remains of Her En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments (the Monuments of the Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Piety of elder Times) envied, and greedily gap'd at by those who again ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and watch for a lucky Revolution of Affairs. Her Governors and regular Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy reproach'd, belibell'd, and affronted upon all Occasions, though generally for no better reason than doing of their Duty, and daring to be honest in an evil time. And in persuance of these ill designs, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies are fram'd without any regard to truth and justice; and no arts, how bad or unwarrantable soever, scrupled, that may serve to wound either Her Interest, or Reputation. And as Schism in the Church seldom fails to draw on Faction in the State, we find the same evil Spirit fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting, and mixing it self with Civil Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and that Character which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle fixt upon the Schismaticks of old, too notoriously reviv'd amongst us, to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous are they, and self-willed,</hi> and seem dispos'd quite contrary to the mild and gentle Spirit of the Gospel, to <hi>beat their Plough-shares into Swords, and their Pruning-hookes into Spears.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is our case; and as sad was theirs in the Age we are speaking of. The <hi>Faith once delivered to the Saints,</hi> as the noblest <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positum</hi> that could be committed to the
<pb facs="tcp:49523:4"/> Church, and which was secur'd and settled with all the Care, which the Piety of the Great <hi>Constantine</hi> could bestow upon it, was yet not only shaken, but attempted to be pluckt up by the roots, and though Truth can be but one, was broken into a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Blasphemies, and lewd Opinions. The Ark of God was toss'd and driven from place to place, and the honour and interest of the Catholic Church run down with all the force, which an insolent and powerful Faction could raise against it. But I had rather your Grace should take the account of their deplorable state from <hi>Nazianzen</hi>'s Pen than Mine.<note place="margin">Orat. XXIII. p. 417.</note> Arianism (says he) <hi>though it began like a little Spark at</hi> Alexandria, <hi>yet like Wild-fire it quickly overran the World; and however for the present stopt and quench'd by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisions of the</hi> Nicene <hi>Council, yet it broke out again in the next Reign, like a Wound slightly cur'd, that opens and runs afresh; when grievous Wolves from several quarters invaded us, and made havock of the Church. Priests were up in Arms against Priests, and one part of the People furiously engaged against another, and under the countenance of the Imperial Authority Laws were made against the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic Doctrine, and that too by the procurement of those who were neither Men nor Women, a Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that govern'd all in that Court. Who can suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently represent the Tragical face of things at that time? the Banishments, Confiscations, Disgraces, the Assemblies kept in the Deserts, the vast Multitudes of Persons, yea whole Cities forc'd to sojourn in the Fields, and open Air, and there to contend with
<pb facs="tcp:49523:4"/> Hunger and Cold, with Wind and Weather, and yet not secure there, the very Wilderness not affording them Safety and Protection; and what is yet more lamentable, the Torments, Deaths, and Triumphs of Bishops, contemplative Ascetics, of Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and those both young and old. Who can set forth the great Ministers that contriv'd these horrible Actings and Sufferings, and those who studied in this kind to out-do one another, and who had this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to the honour of their Enterprize, that they far outwent in Cruelty the design of the Prince that employ'd them.</hi> And then lightly passing over the Reign of <hi>Julian</hi> (whereof he had suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently spoken elsewhere) he proceeds to describe the Miseries which the Catholics endured in the time of <hi>Valens,</hi> which I shall not here represent. In short, so Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous was the state of those Times, that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion must have sunk under its Pressures, or been stifled in a crowd of Heresie and Prophaness, had not God rais'd up an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary race of Men, who set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to oppose that Impiety and Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciousness that was become Epidemical, who by their diligent Preaching rescued the Minds of Men from Errour, and by the Learnedness of their Writings, and their great <hi>Acumen</hi> and dexterity in Disputing <hi>contended earnestly for the Faith,</hi> baffled and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd Gainsayers; who by the exemplari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their Lives ballanc'd the iniquity of the Age, and by their Prayers to Heaven arrested that Vengeance that was ready to overtake the World. 'Twas the Patience
<pb facs="tcp:49523:5"/> and Constancy of <hi>Athanasius,</hi> the Vigour and Activity of S. <hi>Hilary,</hi> the Prudence and Temper of S. <hi>Basil,</hi> the Learning and Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the <hi>Gregories,</hi> the Courage and Impartiality of S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> the Zeal and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemency of S. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> that supported the Catholic Cause, while they liv'd, and ever since rendred their Names Venerable to Posterity.</p>
            <p>Of all these Matters I have endeavored to give some competent Account in the following Lives; but with what Success and Satisfaction, I know not. May the Work prove so happy, as in any measure to gain your Graces Approbation, (so great a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster in Church-Antiquity) and I shall be less solicitous about others; being well as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd, I may much trulier say in this case what <hi>Sozomen</hi> told the younger <hi>Theodosius,</hi> (to whom he dedicated his Ecclesiastic Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) <hi>Whatever shall seem right and acceptable to you,</hi>

               <hi>will certainly appear good and useful to all other Readers; nor will any venture to find fault with what has once past your Graces judgment and examination.</hi> But whatever becomes of the Book it self, if it shall serve to no other purpose, 'twill at least to this, to convey to the World a gratefull Sence of those Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, wherewith your Grace is pleas'd to oblige</p>

For besides what concerns particular Persons, whose Lives and Actions are here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, he will here find an Account of the Fall and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of <hi>Paganism,</hi> the Ancient and Universally recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Religion of the World; of the Conversion of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to the Faith, the Adopting Christianity to be the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the Empire, the Acts and Proceedings of the Two First General Councils, the Advancement of the Church to its greatest height of Splendour, and those lamentable Ruptures, that soon after were made in it by Schism and Faction, by Covetousness and Ambition, and <hi>the cunning Craftiness of those that lay in wait to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It had pleas'd the Divine Wisdom and Providence, now at length to rescue Christianity from the Cruelties of those Heathen Persecutions, which for some Ages had quartered so heavily upon it, and to raise up a Prince to be <hi>a Nursing Father to the Church,</hi> whose Piety made
<pb facs="tcp:49523:6"/> him as willing, as his Power made him able, to protect and defend it. He guarded it with Wise and Prudent Laws, enrich'd it with an immense Bounty and Muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence, honour'd and rever'd its Bishops, encourag'd and nobly provided for its Clergy; demolisht Churches were repair'd, and new ones were erected with all the Pomp and Magnificence, which Cost or Art could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow upon them; the Solemn Assemblies were mightily frequented, and encreas'd by the daily accession of New Converts; the Holy Offices were perform'd with all due Reverence and Devotion, and days of <hi>Jubilee</hi> were kept in every place, in thankfulness to Heaven for so happy a Change and Revolution of Affairs, so blessed a Scene of Prosperity and Safety. It added to the joys of the common triumph, to see <hi>Pagan</hi> Idolatry and Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion going so fast down the Wind, and every where driven into Holes and Corners. All this the Devil, the great Adversary of Mankind, beheld with an Envious and an Evil eye; and because no longer able to assault the Church by Force and Violence, he resolv'd to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taque it by more Secret and Destructive Councils. Hereupon the <hi>Envious Man</hi> betook himself to his old trade of Sowing Tares, stirring up fit Agents and Emis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries to poyson Mens minds with Errour, intending thereby to break the Church into Parties and Factions, and to introduce irreconcileable Feuds and Quarrels; which produc'd Fatal and Mischievous effects, beyond the rage of all the Heathen Persecutions. Nor did these Agents make their onset upon the Out-works of the Faith, but set themselves to undermine the main and Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Articles of Christianity; and whereas hitherto the <hi>Gentiles</hi> had exalted Creatures into the place of God, these Factors endeavour'd to dethrone God into the rank of Creatures.</p>
            <p>The first that enter'd on the Publick Stage, to set on foot this Design, was <hi>Arius,</hi> a Presbyter of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> who being a Man of nimble Parts, and a daring Spirit, openly call'd in Question the Catholic Doctrine concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Divinity, Eternity, and Coessentiality, of the Son of God, and in opposition thereunto advanc'd quite
<pb facs="tcp:49523:6"/> quite contrary Propositions of his own; which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding his shuffling Compliances at every turn to serve his Cause, he stiffly maintain'd while he liv'd, and his Disciples and Followers improv'd and carried on after his decease. The growth and progress of whose perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Heresie, we have with some Care and Diligence trac'd from its very first Originals, remark'd the several steps and advances which it made, and the evil arts which that subtle and potent Faction made use of to promote and further it. The Account whereof we have chiefly lodg'd in the Life of <hi>Athanasius</hi> (the proper Seat of the <hi>Arian</hi> Story) where if any passages seem but hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at, or briefly related, they will be found more at large in some of the other Lives, where they more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly fall in. And because from this root of bitterness many poysonous Branches sprang up; we have taken Notice, as they came in our way, of the several subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Sects and Heresies, that infested the Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this Period.</p>
            <p>But though all along we have kept an eye to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Story, yet we have still remember'd what we had more particularly in design, the Lives of the Learned and Excellent Persons of this Age, whose Story we have drawn together, as far as the Records of those Times would enable us, with useful Reflections upon those Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Graces and Vertues, which rendered them so Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary and Conspicuous in their several Stations: Nor have we forgotten, what conduces not a little to clear the Learned part of their Story, to observe the particular Times and Occasions, upon which many of those Books which they have left behind them, were written. If we have not made so particular a <hi>Crisis</hi> and Censure of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry single Tract, as some Men perhaps may expect, it was because the thing has been done so often, and to far better purposes by others, than I can pretend to do it. And I had no mind to write <hi>Church-Histories</hi> out of <hi>Binius,</hi> or to present the World with <hi>a View of Antiquity,</hi> by tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing what <hi>Scultetus, Cook, Rivet,</hi> &amp;c. what <hi>Possevine, Bellarmin, Labbee,</hi> &amp;c. have said upon those Arguments. However I hope enough is here said to clear the most
<pb facs="tcp:49523:7"/> material Cases, and that their Works are set in such a Light, as will let the World see, how unjust and unscho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar-like that Censure is,<note place="margin">

Treat. of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pisc. p. 1. ch. 14. p. 169.</note> which <hi>a Hater of false History</hi> has past upon the Primitive Fathers, and usher'd in with a, <hi>'Tis past all doubt, that the Number of Learned Bishops among them was very rare; and that there are many Poor men among us, divers Weavers and Plough-men of his own Church at</hi> Kidder-minster, <hi>who are able not only to Pray and Teach, as well as most of those, who are by</hi> Eusebius <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll'd as the Famous Bishops of the Second and Third Age, but to Write as methodical, pious, weighty Tractates, as any that were Written by men that neither convers'd with the Apostles, nor had been bred up in Philosophy; no not excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> Clemens Romanus <hi>himself,</hi> Ignatius, Irenaeus, Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian, Macarius, Ephrem Syrus, Synesius, Isidor Pelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siota, <hi>and many more; and that he could name many Lay-men not only Learned, but such as have neither had many Languages nor Philosophy, who have Written more Accurate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and Judiciously, and as Piously, as any of these.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it shall seem strange to any, that so Learned and Busie an Age of the Church should afford Materials but for Nine Lives (for no more were at first drawn up) that wonder will cease when it is consider'd, that the Story of these Persons is very Large and Comprehensive, and gathers in the Account of most others of Note, which of themselves were not enough to fill up distinct single Lives. However these Papers lying a long time by me, gave me an opportunity to look back upon the Story of this Age, and to gather up the scater'd and imperfect Memoirs, that were left behind; which accordingly I pickt up, and put together, and have thrown into an <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix</hi> at the end of the Book. I might indeed have taken the advantage of the Lives of S. <hi>Augustine, Jerom,</hi> and some others; but their Story runs too far out into the following <hi>Saeculum,</hi> to be properly brought within the compass of this. Besides that, I was sensible that the Volume was already swell'd into too great a bulk, and indeed much greater than I either desired, or intended. And because I had elsewhere observ'd the Methods, by which Christianity had prevail'd in the World, during
<pb facs="tcp:49523:7"/> the times of the Heathen Emperours, I now thought good to premise an Historical Survey of the state of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganism</hi> under the Reign of the First Christian Emperours; though not with that Latitude which the Subject may seem capable of; remembring I wrote not an History but an <hi>Introduction.</hi> I know not whether the Reader may expect to find more particular Accounts of some things relating to the Reign of <hi>Julian</hi> (of late so hotly contested among us.) But besides my natural aversness to Controversie, this <hi>Introduction</hi> was not only Written, but Printed some Months before ever the Dispute was started concerning <hi>Julian,</hi> which has made so much noise amongst us. If the Reader shall meet with any Passages in the body of the Book, which may more properly seem to challenge a place in the Introduction, he may please to take notice, that this last was a Piece of a later date, done after the other was completed. A good part of the Accounts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to this affair, I have borrowed from the Imperial Laws of those times; for adjusting the dates, and ascer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the true meaning of many of which, I own my self oblig'd to the Learned <hi>Monsieur Gothofred,</hi> in his ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate Commentaries on the <hi>Theodosian Code.</hi> The same Author has a small Tract under this Title, <hi>De Statu Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganorum,</hi> &amp;c. but which upon view, as these Papers were going to the Press, I found to be nothing but short Notes, which he afterwards publisht more at large in his Comment on the <hi>Tenth Title</hi> of the last Book of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned <hi>Code, viz.</hi> the Title <hi>de Paganis, Sacrificiis, &amp; Templis.</hi> And pity it is that that Title is so defective, the Laws of Five several Emperours, relating to these matters, <hi>viz. Julian, Jovian, Valentinian, Valens,</hi> and <hi>Gratian,</hi> for the space of no less than Five and twenty Years (the full fourth part of the <hi>Saeculum</hi>) being utterly lost.</p>
            <p>Such is the Work we have here built up. Come we next to the Authors, that furnisht out Materials for it. And herein I have constantly observ'd this Method. In the first place I alwaies had recourse to the Works of that Person, whose Life I desi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n'd to write, as which were likeliest to afford the most certain and satisfactory Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of things. And herein none serv'd me to better
<pb facs="tcp:49523:8"/> purpose, than the Writings of <hi>Athanasius,</hi> who is most pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual and acurate in setting down all the important Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs and Passages of his own Life, and indeed in recording the general Story of those Times. And it could not but seem strange to me, as I suppose it will do to others, that the the Church Historians, <hi>Socrates,</hi> &amp;c. who trade so much in his Writings, have yet so wofully perplext and entangled his Affairs, even in those things which in <hi>Athanasius</hi> himself are very plain and easie. And here by the way, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but bewail the unhappy Fate of this Great mans Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, (and indeed of most of the <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers) that they are generally so ill translated, as must very often unavoidably mislead those that are forc'd to depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. Of the truth whereof, were there no other, <hi>Baronius</hi> is a notorious instance. Next, I betook my self to those who liv'd at the same time with them, or at no great distance from them, and from them pickt up such Historical Remarks as might be most usefull to my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; especially such who had written the Lives of any of the Antients, that liv'd not long before them. Last of all, I apply'd my self to the Ecclesiastical Historians; the chief whereof (setting aside <hi>Eusebius,</hi> of whom else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, and a small part of whose History relates to this period) are Four, all Writing much about the same time, <hi>viz. Socrates, Sozomen, Theodorit,</hi> and <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storgius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Socrates</hi> was born at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> probably about the beginning of the Reign of <hi>Theodosius,</hi> educated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der two Famous Masters, <hi>Helladius</hi> and <hi>Ammonius,</hi> who having fled from <hi>Alexandria,</hi> had open'd a Grammar-School in the Imperial City. Being grown up, he turn'd <hi>Advocate,</hi> (thence term'd <hi>Scholasticus</hi>) and pleaded Causes. In his declining Age, he set himself to write the History of the Church, which he dispatcht in Seven Books, beginning where <hi>Eusebius</hi> left, and ending <hi>Anno</hi> CCCCXXXIX. A Work designedly written in a plain style, but with singular Industry and Fidelity, and which he review'd and corrected more than once. Nor did he trade in flying Reports, the Accounts he gives being either of such things as himself had seen, or had
<pb facs="tcp:49523:8"/> receiv'd from credible Eye-witnesses; or transcribed from Records of unquestionable Authority. As to his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion he was a Catholic, for though some Passages in his History look favourably upon the <hi>Novatians,</hi> yet they are not sufficient to evince him to have been of that side.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sozomen</hi> was descended of Ancestors that were of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laestine</hi> extraction, he studied the Law at <hi>Berytus,</hi> the University of the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws. And thence betook him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to the practick part of them, <hi>viz.</hi> to plead Causes at <hi>Constantinople.</hi> During this employment he set upon Writing an Ecclesiastical History, which he began from the Birth of Christ, and brought down to the deposing of <hi>Licinius.</hi> But this 'tis like was nothing but a <hi>Compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi> of <hi>Eusebius</hi>'s History, and is long since lost. Hence he carried it on through the Reigns of the several Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, 'till the times of the younger <hi>Theodosius,</hi> to whom he Dedicated it. His Style is even, and very agreeable to his Subject, wherein he goes as far beyond <hi>Socrates,</hi> as he falls short of him in judgment and accuracy. They both liv'd at the same time, and it admits of some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate which of them Wrote first; but there are some circumstances that adjudge the precedency to <hi>Socrates,</hi> and this not the least, that <hi>Sozomen</hi> frequently adds to, and enlarges the others Relations and Accounts of things.</p>
            <p>The next that succceds is <hi>Theodorit,</hi> born at or near <hi>Antioch</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> devoted by his Parents to a very strict and devout Life; and accordingly brought up under great Severity of Discipline, especially under the Care and Tutorage of <hi>Theodorus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Mopsuestia.</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd afterwards to the Bishoprick of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> a City built by the <hi>Jews</hi> in honour of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> the great <hi>Persian</hi> Prince. A Man of excellent Learning, and admirable Parts, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the many Monuments whereof, which he has transmitted to Posterity, his Ecclesiastical History is not least considerable; consisting of Five Books (though there are that say he writ as many more) which he publisht not till some time after those that had writ before him, whose Defects and Omissions he design'd
<pb facs="tcp:49523:9"/> to supply, especially as to the Church Affairs of the <hi>Eastern</hi> parts, where himself liv'd. His Style and way of Writing is highly commended by the incomparable <hi>Photius,</hi> as more polisht, clear, and equal, and every ways adapted to an Historical strain.</p>
            <p>Contemporary with the rest was <hi>Philostorgius,</hi> a <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>padocian,</hi> the Son of <hi>Carterius,</hi> and <hi>Eulampia,</hi> born about the Year CCCLXVIII. At twenty Years of Age he came to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> to accomplish his Studies, and attain'd to a great Proficiency in all the polite, as well as usefull parts, both of Secular and Sacred Learning. As to his Religion he was an <hi>Arian,</hi> and that of the worst stamp, an <hi>Eunomian,</hi> as also his Parents were before him. He wrote an History of the Church from the rise of <hi>Arius,</hi> till about the Year CCCCXXV. which he digested into XII. Books, with this peculiar contrivance, that the first Letter of every Book, being taken in order, and put together, ingeniously expresses the Author's Name. Though his Style be generally very neat and good, yet his Accounts are intolerably partial; his design through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole being to expose the Catholics, and to vindicate the <hi>Arians,</hi> especially <hi>Aetius</hi> and <hi>Eunomius,</hi> making all his Relations look in favour of them. So that as <hi>Photius</hi> well observes, his Book seems rather a Paneg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rick upon Heresie, than an Ecclesiastical History. For which reason he cannot safely be trusted in those things, wherein the interests of <hi>Arianism,</hi> but especially <hi>Eunomianism,</hi> are particularly concern'd. His History has either miscarried, or has not yet seen the light; only the large <hi>excerpta,</hi> which <hi>Photius</hi> long since made out of it, are still preserv'd, and were first publisht with an usefull Comment by that Learned <hi>French</hi> Lawyer <hi>Jacobus Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hofredus,</hi> whom we mention'd before. In short, the Authorities of the Antients, which we rely upon, are generally Authentick, and unquestionable, and need no suffrages to support their Credit.</p>
            <p>As for Writers of a modern and later date, we have made little use of them, especially such as have parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly dealt in this way of writing Lives. I know the Lives of several of these Fathers have of late times been
<pb facs="tcp:49523:9"/> written in <hi>French.</hi> But besides that, my unacquainted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness with that Language had kept me from knowing what they had done in that kind, their laxe and diffuse way of writing Lives made me less curious and solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous in enquiring after it. Whether herein I have done Well or Ill, I know not; sure I am, I have gratified my own Inclinations. For it being my design to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive the notices of things immediately from the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain head, I thought it to little purpose to go so great away about, for what I must come to at last. I have but one thing more, and that is to request the Learned Reader, that if he chance to meet with any material Mistakes, besides those that lie at the Printers door, he would please to drop a soft and favorable Censure, considering that the Work is large, and the searches that were to be made Diffuse and Various, and which necessarily drew such an hurry of thoughts along with them, as perhaps might not always leave Consideration at home, minutely to weigh every thing in an exact ballance. Not that I am conscious to my self of having been wanting in any Point, either of Fidelity or Care, but that after all, I dare not confidently secure my self from Error. If the Reader shall be at any time at a loss in Circumstances that relate to time, I desire him to consult the <hi>Chronological Table,</hi> which I have added at the end of the Book.</p>

                  <label>SECT. III. The State of <hi>Paganism</hi> under the Reign of JULIAN.</label>
                  <hi>Julian</hi>'s Parentage, and Education under several Masters. His inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to Paganaism nourish'd by <hi>Libanius</hi> and others, who blew him up with hopes of the Empire. His subtile dissimulation of Christianity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd by his greatest admirers. His taking upon him the place of a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and erecting an Oratory to S. <hi>Mamas</hi> the Martyr. His residence at <hi>Athens,</hi> and frequent consulting with Pagan Priests. His driving away the <hi>Daemons</hi> at a Consult, by an undesign'd making the sign of the Cross. Advanc'd to the Dignity of <hi>Caesar,</hi> upon what account. Sent into <hi>Gaul</hi> to govern there, and to repress the <hi>Germans.</hi> Auspicious Omens at his arrival there. His great success, and assuming the Empire. An account of it sent to <hi>Constantius,</hi> and his passionate Resentment of it. <hi>Julian</hi>'s preparation to march against <hi>Constantius.</hi> His gradual opening his Resolutions to restore Paganism, and his caressing the greater Cities to that purpose. The frowardness of some zealous Gentiles in setting up their Superstitions. His arrival at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and public care about the restitution of the Gentile Rites, their Temples, Altars, Sacrifices, Ceremonies, Revenues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> His Zeal for these things in his own Person and Practice. The principal methods he made use of for the suppressing Christianity, and restoring the Gentile Religion, considered. His design to reform Paganism from its more gross Abuses; an Abstract of his wise Discourses, and prudent Directions to that end: His endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to conform it to the excellent Institutions of Christianity; his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>Arsacius,</hi> Chief-Priest of <hi>Galatia,</hi> to that purpose. His taking all occasions of exposing Christians, and making them and their Religion appear ridiculous. His Wit mainly employ'd that way. The Title of <hi>Galileans</hi> by Law fix'd upon them. The blasphemous Speeches and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises
<pb facs="tcp:49523:11"/> of others after his Example, and their fatal and miserable Ends. His traducing the Emperour <hi>Constantine,</hi> as a person dear to Christians. His attempts to bring Christians low, and to weaken their Power and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, by banishing them from all places of Honour and Trust, by unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Fines and Taxations, and by setting the several Parties of Christians at variance with each other. Instances given of all these. His conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at the Persecution rais'd against the Christians by his Commanders and Governours. His abstaining from open Persecution, why; tho it fell heavy upon particular persons and places. His discouraging and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving away the Bishops and Clergy, and abolishing their Revenues and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges. The policy of that attempt. His encouraging the <hi>Jews,</hi> and restoring their Temple and Religion, in opposition to the Christians. The advantages which he propounded to himself therein. His endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to extinguish all Humane Learning among the Christians, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to make them more plyable to <hi>Gentile</hi> Insinuations. The folly of that attempt. The infinite encouragement he gave to Philosophers, and all that appear'd able and zealous against Christians. His project to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snare unwary Christians into a compliance with Pagan Superstition. Some Instances given of it. The Historical part of the remainder of his time briefly prosecuted. His expedition against <hi>Persia.</hi> The Orations he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd in his march in honour of the Pagan Deities. His coming to <hi>Antioch,</hi> and reproaching them with the notorious neglect of the <hi>Gentile</hi> Rites. The scurrilous Reflections cast upon him by the people of that City. His writing his <hi>Misopogon,</hi> a Satyrical Discourse, to be reveng'd of them. His departure from <hi>Antioch,</hi> and execrable Divinations at <hi>Carrae,</hi> the Reliques whereof found after his Death. His engagement with the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians,</hi> ill Success, and Death. The Author of his Death unknown: Several Reports concerning it; charg'd by <hi>Libanius</hi> upon the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians. Some extraordinary passages relating to his Death. His Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter. The seasonableness of his Death to the Christians. <hi>Nazianzen</hi>'s triumphant Discourse upon it. <hi>Pag. 25.</hi>

                  <label>SECT. IV. In what Case <hi>Gentilism</hi> stood under the Reigns of JOVIAN, VALENTINIAN, and VALENS.</label>
                  <hi>Jovian</hi> chosen Emperour, resolutely refuses it, 'till the Army professes it self Christian. He is traduc'd by the Pagans for his Zeal towards Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, which he owns to be the true Religion. His granting some kind of Indulgence to Men of any Religion. The great Commendations given him by <hi>Themistius</hi> the Philosopher upon that account. Moderation in Religion highly cried up and pleaded for by the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> when themselves stood in need of it. The sudden Death of <hi>Jovian. Valentinian</hi> elected by the Army. His Zeal against Pagan Idolatry, and sufferings upon that account in the time of <hi>Julian.</hi> His Brother <hi>Valens</hi> taken into a Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nership
<pb facs="tcp:49523:12"/> in the Government. Indulgence granted to every one to use his own way of Worship. This Liberty abus'd by the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and therefore retrench'd by several Laws. No Christians to be condemned to the Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatory Sports, or to be forc'd to guard the Heathen Temples. The vanity of a Prediction of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that the Christian Religion should last but CCCLXV Years. All divinatory Consultations severely prohibited in the <hi>Eastern</hi> Parts. A magical <hi>Tripos</hi> made by the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> for enquiring after <hi>Valens</hi> his Successor, and the manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting it: <hi>Theodorus,</hi> a <hi>Gentile,</hi> intimated to be the Person. These Transactions discovered to <hi>Valens,</hi> who puts to death all Persons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in the Conspiracy. A severe Process against all Philosophers and Magicians. <hi>Maximus,</hi> Tutor to <hi>Julian,</hi> beheaded upon this occasion. Great rigour us'd towards all whose Names began with THEOD, and yet <hi>Theodosius</hi> escap'd, and was his Successor. Books of Magic ordered to be burnt. St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> in danger upon that account. Smart Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings against the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in the <hi>West,</hi> but moderated by the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of the Senate. Priviledges granted to the Provincial Priests. The <hi>Saracens,</hi> when and how converted to the Christian Faith. <hi>Arria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism,</hi> how it crept in among the <hi>Goths.</hi> Their Letters invented, and the Bible translated into that Language by <hi>Ulphilas</hi> their Bishop. <hi>Valens</hi> his Rage against the Catholicks mitigated by an Oration which <hi>Themistius</hi> the Philosopher made to him to that purpose. <hi>Pag. 50.</hi>

                  <label>SECT. V. The State of Pagan Religion under the Reigns of GRATIAN, THEODOSIUS the Great, and his Successors.</label>
                  <hi>Theodosius</hi> advanc'd by <hi>Gratian</hi> to the <hi>Eastern</hi> Empire. His restraining the boldness &amp; liberty of the Pagans, by severe Laws against Apostacy, Sacrifices, Divinations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Gentilism hereby reduc'd to a low ebb. Particular provision about the Temple at <hi>Aedessa. Gratian</hi> refuses the Sacerdotal Stole, and the Title of <hi>Pontifex Maximus,</hi> hitherto worn by Christian Emperours. Proceedings against Paganism reviv'd, and more briskly carried on in the East. The famous Temple of <hi>Sarapis</hi> at <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria</hi> defac'd, and the ridiculous Follies of Gentile Idolatry publickly expos'd. Sedition and Tumult hereupon rais'd by the Gentiles, and great mischief done to Christians. The Reformation carried on by <hi>Theophilus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> The celebrated Image of <hi>Sarapis</hi> openly burnt. The Ruin of this Temple foretold by the Gentiles themselves. The rest of the Temples at <hi>Alexandria</hi> demolish'd. The lewdness and debaucheries usually committed in those places shewn by a particular instance. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Churches erected over those places. The River <hi>Nilus</hi> not flowing so plentifully as formerly. This charg'd by the Gentiles as a punishment from the Gods for the destruction of their Temples; but prov'd false by a contrary Event. The same Reformation carried on in the <hi>Eastern</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:49523:12"/> Parts. The miraculous demolishing a Temple at <hi>Apamea</hi> by <hi>Marcellus</hi> Bishop of that place. <hi>Theodosius</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> perswades the Gentile part of the Senate to become Christians, but is obstinately rejected. <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus</hi> for his insolence and importunity banish'd <hi>Rome.</hi> The Gentile Cause undertaken, and <hi>ex professo</hi> pleaded by <hi>Libanius:</hi> The Sum of his Oration <hi>de Templis</hi> presented to the Emperour, but nothing gain'd from him. Attempts of the Gentiles against his Life. Several Edicts for the Suppression of Pagan Rites. <hi>Theodosius</hi> his last Law against the whole Body of their Religion, and the several Parts and Branches of it. The Death of that good Emperour. The same work pursued by <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadius</hi> his Son and Successor. The remaining Temples pull'd down, and the Materials dispos'd of to publick Buildings. The Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> petitions <hi>Honorius</hi> for the abolishing the Remainders of Idolatrous Rites in <hi>Afric,</hi> with the Emperour's Answer. Several Laws of <hi>Honorius,</hi> and the younger <hi>Theodosius,</hi> in pursuance of the same Design thorough all Parts of the Empire, briefly noted. Paganism afraid to show its head, and generally driven into Corners. The whole concluded with a short Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capitulation out of <hi>Theoderit. Pag. 58.</hi>

The Story of his rending the Curtain that had a Picture on it in the Church of <hi>Anablatha.</hi> The vain shifts of the <hi>Romish</hi> Writers to evade this Testimony against Image-Worship.

The Gentiles vext at his kindness to Christians, and his neglecting the <hi>Ludi Saeculares.</hi> The favourable Edict, and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable End of <hi>Maximinus. Licinius</hi> raises a grievous Persecution in the East, is encountred by <hi>Constantine,</hi> overthrown, and put to death. The Imperial Monarchy resting in <hi>Constantine.</hi> His Laws against Southsayers, and the practisers of Magic Charms. His care about the Lord's day, and form of Prayer prescrib'd to his Heathen Soldiers to be us'd upon that day. The Gentiles forbidden to compel Christians to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at their Solemn Rites. Laws made in behalf of Christians. The Emperours Letters to the Provincial Governours, persuading the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles to come over to Christianity. The Seat of the Empire remov'd from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and why. The great Privileges conferr'd upon that City. <hi>Constantine</hi>'s care to rout and expose all Monuments of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Impiety there. The successful propagation of Christianity in several Countries without the bounds of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. Severer Procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings against Pagan Superstitions. Commissions dispatcht into several Countries for the routing all Monuments of Idolatry. Temples shut up, and many of them demolisht. Greater Connivence herein at <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi> than in other places. <hi>Constantine</hi>'s Death; his Piety; and the happy state of his Reign above that of preceding Emperours.</p>

The subject of this Discourse will be to observe by what degrees <hi>Paganism,</hi> that part of it espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that was the public and standing Religion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion that for so many Ages had influenc'd the Minds of Men, and seem'd firmly rooted by Custom, Laws, and an inveterate prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, was driven into corners, and in effect banisht out of the World. The main of the Story lies within the compass of the Age we write of, and being a Subject both pleasant in it self, and that which will reflect no mean Light upon several passages in the following Lives, it will not, I conceive, be unuseful here to lay it all together. The ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count whereof we shall briefly deduce from the time that the Empire became Christian.</p>

He sought therefore under pretence of Sports and martial Exercises to have dispatch'd him out of the way; but the Divine Providence still brought him off. His Father had often sent for him, and had as oft been delay'd. And now again in his Sickness had renew'd his Importunity, till <hi>Galerius</hi> asham'd any longer to deny so reasonable a request, gave him a Warrant under Seal to be gone, intending nothing less, but that by some device he would stop his Journey, and therefore willed him to come to him again the next Morning to receive his final Instructions and Commands. But no sooner was the Emperour gone to bed, but <hi>Constantine</hi> immediately took Horse, and at every Stage where he came, besides those few he made use of, he ham-string'd all the Post-Horses that he left behind him. The next day <hi>Galerius</hi> call'd for him, but was told, That he was gone the night before: He gave order to go after him, and when he understood that all the Post-Horses were disabled, he burst out into an equal passion of Rage and Grief. <hi>Constantine</hi> in the mean while made hast, and arriv'd at <hi>York</hi> four days before his Father died. Upon whose decease, and by whose Last-Will he succeeded in the <hi>Western</hi> Empire, unanimously saluted by the joyful Acclamations of the Army, and readily submitted to by the <hi>Western</hi> Provinces.

No sooner was he engag'd in this Expedition, but like a prudent and good Man he began to think of some assistance beyond the meer strength and courage of his Army, and knowing there was great variety of Deities at that time worship'd in the World, his first care was, which of these to pitch upon, and implore as his Protector and tutelar Guardian. He observ'd the fatal miscarriages of his Predecessors, that had stickled hard for a multiplicity of Gods, had repos'd entire confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in their assistance, and courted their favour by all the formal and fond Rites of Worship; notwithstanding all which, their Wars had been generally improsperous, and they themselves brought to unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and untimely ends: On the contrary, that his Father had acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd and ador'd one only God, and him the supreme Governour of the World, who had strangely succeeded his Undertakings, and given him many illustrious Instances of a Divine Power and Goodness through the whole Series of his Life; so thereupon he grew to this Resolution, to lay aside the vulgar Deities, who 'tis plain did but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to Divinity, and cheat the World, and to adhere only to the God of his Father; to whom therefore he addressed himself, beseech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to make himself known to him, and effectually to assist him in this expedition. And Heaven heard his Prayer, and answered it in a most miraculous manner, so wonderful, that <hi>Eusebius,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports it, grants, it would not have been credible, if he had not had it from <hi>Constantine</hi>'s own mouth, who solemnly ratified the truth of it with his Oath. The Army was upon their march, and the Emperour taken up with these devout Ejaculations, when the Sun declining, (about three of the Clock, as 'tis probable, in the Afternoon) there suddenly appear'd a Pillar of Light in the Heavens in the fashion of a Cross, whereon (or as others, about it) was this Inscription (in <hi>Latin</hi> say some, but <hi>Eusebius</hi> mentions not that) exprest in Letters form'd by a configuration of Stars, (if what <hi>Philostorgius,</hi>

Early the next Morning he got up, and told his Friends what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd, and sending immediately for Workmen, sat down by them, and describ'd to them the form of the thing, which he commanded them to make with the most exquisite Artifice and Magnificence, and
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:49523:29"/> they made it accordingly after this manner: A long Spear plated over with Gold, with a Traverse piece at the top a little Oblique, in the fashion of a Cross; to this Cross-piece was fasten'd a four-square Curtain of purple, embroider'd and beset with Gold and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Stones, which reflected a most amazing lustre, and towards the top of it were pictur'd the Emperour in the midst of his Sons. On the top of the shaft above the Cross stood a Crown over-laid with Gold and Jewels, within which were plac'd the sacred Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol, <hi>viz.</hi> the two first Letters of Christ's name in <hi>Greek,</hi> X and P,<note place="margin">

This Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Standard in all his Wars was carried before him; and my Author assures us, he had often seen it. And in imitation of this he caused Banners (which they call'd <hi>Labara</hi>) to be made for the rest of the Army, continued by his Christian Successors, tho not always keeping exactly to the same form. 'Tis true, the Gentile Writers make no express mention of this apparition of the Cross, nor is it reasonable to expect they should: But this they confess, which they say was a currant and uncontradicted report in the mouth of all, that before this Engagement an Army in the Air was seen to come down from Heaven, persons of great strength and stature, with vigorous and chearful looks, and bright flaming Armour, who were heard to say, <hi>We seek for</hi> Constantine, <hi>we are come to assist him;</hi> as the Heathen Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor<note n="k" place="margin">Nazar.

                     <p n="4">IV. <hi>CONSTANTINE</hi> had a mighty curiosity to be farther instructed in these Divine significations, and therefore calling for some Christian Bishops, ask'd them, who this God was, and what he meant by this sign. They told him, the person that had done this was the only-begotten Son of the one only God; the Sign that had appear'd to him was the Symbol of Immortality, and the Trophy of that Victory, which this God while he was upon Earth, had gain'd over Death: They explain'd to him the reasons of his coming down from Heaven, and the state of his Incarnation, and undertaking the cause of Mankind. He heard their Discourses with great pleasure and satisfaction, but kept himself upon the reserve, like a wary and prudent Man, not giving too much way at first; he oft compar'd the heavenly Vision with what they had discoursed to him upon that Argument, and the more he did so, the more he was satisfied, not doubting but that in due time God would more perfectly discover these things to him; in order whereunto he resolv'd at leasure hours to peruse the Holy Scriptures. But herein he kept his thoughts to himself, nor indeed for the present was it safe for him to declare them. However assur'd in his own mind he march'd through <hi>Italy,</hi>

<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:49523:30"/> justly jeers him. But <hi>Constantine</hi> now approaching, he saw he must leave the City, and therefore plied the Altars with numerous Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and commanded the <hi>Sibylline</hi> Books to be search'd, and the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer brought him was, That that day the great Enemy of <hi>Rome</hi> should perish. This he understood of <hi>Constantine,</hi> and applied the success to himself, and the rather 'tis like, because it was then his Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day. So having put all things into the best posture he could, he quitted the City, and came out against <hi>Constantine</hi> with far more numerous Forces, his Infantry consisting of an hundred and seventy thousand Foot, and his Cavalry of eighteen thousand Horse, a great part where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of being <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Italians,</hi> and having smarted so much under his insolent Tyranny, desired nothing more than to see him fall at the Enemies foot. The Engagement was fierce and bloody, 'till Victory having hover'd a while, rested on <hi>Constantine</hi>'s side, for the Enemies Cavalry being routed, the whole Army fled, and thinking to escape the nearest way by a Bridge of Boats, which <hi>Maxentius</hi> had built over the <hi>Tyber,</hi> and had contriv'd with secret Springs and Engins on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to drown <hi>Constantine</hi> if he pass'd that way, were caught in their own Trap, and fell into the Pit which they had digg'd for others. For the Engins giving way, the Boats parted, and overpress'd with the weight of the Company sunk to the bottom of the River, and <hi>Maxentius</hi> himself along with them, whose Body being found, his Head was stricken off, and carried upon a Pole before the Army.</p>
                     <p n="5">V.

The first thing he did was to set up a standing Monument of his Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to that God, by whose assistance he had gain'd the Victory, which he did, or rather the Senate by his direction, by erecting a Statue to him in the most eminent part of the City, (and this I take to be the <hi>Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> which the Orator<note n="o" place="margin">Paneg. supr. cit. p. <hi>47.</hi> vid.

And it added not a little to their Trouble, when they found that <hi>Maximinus</hi> himself, upon whom they relied so much, began to turn upon them: For falling out with <hi>Licinius,</hi>

And either in spite to them, or in this declining state of his Affairs to keep in with so numerous a Party, he publish'd an Edict<note n="a" place="margin">Ext. ap. Eus. loc. cit.</note> in behalf of the Christians, wherein he confirm'd the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script which he had sent to <hi>Sabinus</hi> the year before, and supplied now what was defective in it, <hi>viz.</hi> the restitution of their Churches, with all those Revenues and Possessions which had been seiz'd into the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer, and either sold, or bestow'd upon any public Corporations, or private persons. Not long after, just as he was resolv'd to try his fortunes in a second Battel, he was struck with infinite pains and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments all over his Body, so that in a little time he wasted to nothing,
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:49523:31"/> and his very Eye-sight failing, he became stark blind, and died at <hi>Tarsus,</hi> confessing upon his Death-bed, that all this was but a just pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment upon him for his spiteful and virulent proceedings against Christ, and his Religion.

In compassion to whose deplorable case, and to chastise this Man's monstrous Inconstancy and Ingratitude, (whom no ties of Blood, Friendship, or Interest, could oblige) and his horrible Perfidiousness and Hypocrisie, <hi>Constantine</hi> resolv'd upon an Expedition against him. The Armies first met at <hi>Cybalis</hi> in <hi>Panonia,</hi> where <hi>Licinius</hi> was worsted, but afterwards recollecting his Forces, engag'd again in <hi>Thrace,</hi> at what time <hi>Constantine,</hi> in the midst of his Bishops and Chaplains, was earnestly engaging Heaven by Prayer to be on his side, while <hi>Licinius</hi> on the other hand laugh'd at him, and calling for his Priests and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune-tellers, his <hi>Aruspices</hi> or Diviners, fell to sacrificing, enquiring what Judgment they made by inspecting the Intrails of the Beasts; the Expounders of Dreams likewise were at hand, and the <hi>Auspices</hi> that divin'd by the flight of Birds, who unanimously agreed, that Success would wait upon him. Whereupon he took the chief Officers of his Army into a private Grove, thick set with the Images of their Gods, where having lighted Torches, and perform'd the accustom'd Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, he made this Oration to them, which my Author had from the mouth of those that heard it. <q>Gentlemen, <hi>said he,</hi> and Fellow-Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, these are the Gods of our Country, whom we worship accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to immemorial Custom and Tradition deriv'd from our Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors. The Enemy that fights against us, is one that has renounc'd the Religion of his Country, and join'd himself to an impious Sect, and being thus impos'd on, has chosen I know not what strange Deity for his God, with whose <hi>infamous sign</hi> he dishonours his Army, and in confidence of it is come forth not so much against us, as against the Gods themselves, whom he has thus vilified and rejected. To day will shew which of us is in the right, and whether ours or theirs be the true Gods. For either the Victory which we shall obtain, will evidently declare our Gods to be the Saviours and Deliverers, or if notwithstanding their number this strange and obscure God of <hi>Constantine</hi> shall get the better, no Man will then any longer doubt which God he ought to worship, but will go over to the most power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:49523:32"/> Deity, and ascribe to him the honour of the Victory. And if this strange God, whom we now so much despise, shall appear to be the more powerful Being, we our selves also ought to embrace and adore him, and bid adieu to those, to whom we have lighted our Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers to so little purpose. But if ours carry the day, which no Man can doubt, after such a signal Victory, we may securely go on in our attempts against these impious Contemners of the Gods.</q> The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies now fac'd each other, and <hi>Constantine</hi> having piously recommended his Cause to God, gave the Signal, the Imperial Standard of the Cross was born before him, fifty Men being peculiarly deputed to guard it, and to carry it by turns; which way soever it turn'd, the Enemy fled, so that when the Emperour saw any part of the Army press'd hard upon, he Call'd for the Cross to that place, and it turn'd the Scale. The Engagement was renew'd in several Encounters, 'till the Enemies Forces being wholly broken, the greatest part threw down their Arms, and yielded, and <hi>Licinius</hi> himself fled the Field; who finding his Affairs desperate, betook himself to his old arts of Treachery and Dissimulation, begging Peace with <hi>Constantine,</hi> who readily accepted the motion, the other ratifying it with his Oath. But what Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions can hold a bad Man? All is soon forgotten, and <hi>Licinius</hi> raises another Army, but charges his Soldiers to offer no violence to the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of the Cross, nor to engage near it. The Battel, tho bloody, went against him, who fled thereupon to <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> whither <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> follow'd, and besieg'd him. But he surrender'd himself upon condition of life, which he promised to lead private and obscure, and which some say <hi>Constantine</hi> granted, and confirm'd with his Oath. However that was, he sent him to <hi>Thessalonica,</hi> and there, upon his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting new Seditions, put him to death.</p>

And that none might be then unem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd, he took care that his Pagan Army should be busied in Prayer to Heaven, as the only giver of all Victory, and upon every Lord's day should go out in the open Fields, and there, upon a Signal given, fall down, and offer up their Requests in a form of Prayer, which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self compos'd, and commanded them to learn by heart, in these words: <hi>We do acknowledge thee to be the only God, we confess thee to be King, upon thee do we call for help.

And in this Edict, as he styles Christianity <hi>The most holy Law,</hi> so he calls Gentilism <hi>Alienam Superstitionem,</hi> a strange Superstition.

That to <hi>Eusebius,</hi> being the first that was written, is still extant, written <hi>Ann.</hi> CCCXXIV. soon after the final Defeat of <hi>Licinius,</hi> whom he styles in it that <hi>great Dragon,</hi> which by his Ministry God had remov'd from the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Besides this, he wrote a large exhortatory Epistle to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Governours of the <hi>East,</hi> wherein with great Wisdom and Piety he persuades all his Subjects to embrace Christianity, a Religion atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted by the Heathen Deities themselves, whereof he assures them him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self was an Ear-witness, <hi>Apollo'</hi> s Oracle confessing, that certain righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous persons were the cause why he could no longer deliver out true Oracles. And when <hi>Diocletian</hi> (whom he then attended) ask'd, who these Men were? One of the Priests answer'd, They were the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians: Which so enrag'd the bloody Emperour, that he immediately publish'd the most severe merciless Edicts against the Christians, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the Judges to contrive more exquisite Instruments of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than what the Law had hitherto provided for them. But tho he endeavour'd both by Prayers and Arguments to bring them over to the Truth, yet he still left them to the freedom of their own choice. He would not, he tells them, force them to change their Religion, nor that one Party should offer any injury or violence to the other upon that account: If they would still obstinately persist in their old way, let them enjoy their Temples stuff'd with nothing but Lies and Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoods; assuring them it was not true, what some reported, that he had abolish'd the Rites of their Temples, and their Religious Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities: He wished indeed they would steer the same Course that he had done, and doubted not to have persuaded the World to it, if the power and efficacy of an inveterate Errour, deep rooted in the minds of Men, had not prejudic'd the design'd Reformation of Mankind.

The Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners enter'd every where into the Temples, and threw open the Doors of their most secret <hi>Revestries,</hi> so that those Mysteries, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-time none but the Priests might behold, were now publicly expos'd to the Eyes of the People, and many of the Temples untiled, and laid open to all Storms and Weather. The common people were afraid, and durst make no resistance, and the Priests and <hi>Flamens</hi> being left alone, quietly submitted, and did themselves bring forth their most venerable Deities, which being stript of their external Pageantry and Ornament, were shewn in their own colours to every vulgar Eye. The Statues of Gold, and like precious Materials, were melted down, and coin'd into Money, the best of those that were curiously wrought in Brass were brought up to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where they were drawn with Ropes up and down the Streets, and set up for the people to behold and laugh at. Here might you have seen the <hi>Pythian,</hi> there the <hi>Smin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian Apollo;</hi> in the <hi>Circus</hi> were plac'd the famous <hi>Tripodes</hi> brought from <hi>Delphos,</hi> in the Palace the <hi>Muses</hi> of <hi>Helicon,</hi> in another place the great God <hi>Pan,</hi> so solemnly and universally worship'd in <hi>Greece,</hi> plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted there as standing Monuments to Posterity of the folly and madness of Pagan Superstition. At <hi>Aphaca</hi> in <hi>Phaenicia</hi> near the top of Mount <hi>Libanus,</hi> stood a famous Temple in the midst of a Grove, dedicated
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:49523:34"/> to <hi>Venus,</hi> where the Men busied themselves in performing the Rites of Worship, while the Women prostituted themselves to all manner of Lewdness in every corner. This Temple the Emperour commanded to be pull'd down to the ground, and all its rich Gifts and Ornaments to be disposed of, and that lewd Society to be dispers'd and scatter'd. There was another dedicated to her at <hi>Heliopolis</hi> in the same Country, where the Men gave leave to their Wives and Daughters to prostitute themselves in honour of the Goddess; this he abolish'd, and built a Church in the room of it, and furnish'd it with a Bishop and other Ministers of Religion. <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Oak at <hi>Mamre,</hi> which for so many Ages had been annually defil'd with Jewish and Heathenish Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, he remov'd, and erected a Christian Church there. He demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd the celebrated Temple of <hi>Aesculapius</hi> at <hi>Aegae</hi> in <hi>Cilicia,</hi> where that pretended God was worship'd for his eminent Cures, and frequent appearances in Dreams to his Votaries. At <hi>Alexandria</hi> he dispers'd and banish'd the <hi>Androgyni,</hi>

In short, by several Laws he forbad to offer Sacrifices, or to erect any Images to the Gods, or to consult their Priests and Oracles, or to exercise any of their Mysterious Rites. And tho <hi>Libanius</hi> more than once affirms,<note n="c" place="margin">Or. de Templ. p. <hi>20, 21.</hi>
                        </note> that their Temples were left open, and Sacrifices permitted at <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi> yet was it no otherwise true, than as they could do it by stealth, or by connivance, not by any public allowance or constitution of the Empire.

But when my Author<note n="d" place="margin">De Templ. p. <hi>9, 22.</hi>
                        </note> affirms, that <hi>Constantine,</hi> tho he took away their Revenues, made no alteration in the ancient usages of their Worship, he must be understood of the former part of his Reign, it being unquestionably evident from the Testimony both of Christian and Gentile Writers,<note n="e" place="margin">Hieron.

His own vacant time he spent in Prayer, reading the Scriptures, and other divine Exercises and Employments, and he form'd his whole Court after his Example. He paid a just Reverence to the victorious Cross, and erected triumphal Arches to it in every place, and with a noble and magnificent bounty commanded Churches and Orato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to be built, and those to be re-edified which had been demolish'd by the rage and madness of his Predecessors, who taking upon them
<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:49523:35"/> to fight against God, had all come to untimely ends, and both they and their Families been swept away as in a moment. While this Emperour, guarded by the salutary Standard, carried Victory about him, and had founded newer and more stately Churches, and re-built the old ones into greater Magnificence than before; conspicuous Instances whereof were to be seen at <hi>Constantinople, Nicomedia, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> and in <hi>Palestine,</hi> where at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> he rais'd an immense and admirable Structure over the place of our Saviour's Sepulcher, which he enrich'd and adorn'd with the most exquisite Artifice.

A signal Evidence of that Divine Power that superintended the happiness of the Empire, that could so equally distribute Recompences suitable to each party: For all those that had ruin'd and laid wast the Churches, had quickly reap'd the Wages of their Impiety, and had been swept away without leaving either House or Posterity behind them. But this good Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour having endear'd himself to Heaven by an unusual Piety and Bounty, had accordingly engag'd God to be the Saviour and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of his Empire, his Family, and his Posterity.</q>

                        </note> the year following against this sort of Men, setting forth, that altho in any part of the World they were to be accounted Enemies of Mankind, yet when they presum'd to intrude into his Court or Presence, they offer'd a more immediate violence to Majesty. If therefore any Magician or Diviner, or any practising that way, should be found either in his Court, or in that of <hi>Caesar,</hi> be he of what rank or condition soever, he should not escape being tortur'd, tho in other cases the Law exempted persons of Honour and Dignity from that Penalty; so that if upon proof he still persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted to deny the Fact, notwithstanding the privilege of his Place and Quality, he should, as in ordinary cases of High-Treason, be put upon the Rack, and have his flesh rak'd off his sides with <hi>Ungulae,</hi> or Iron Hooks, made on purpose to torment the Malefactor.

This the Man kept secret, and march'd out with the Army; but his Wife, jealous of her own Interest, wrote to him, to beg, that after <hi>Constantius</hi>'s Death, which was then at hand, and himself, according to his expectations, advanc'd to the Empire, he would not despise her, nor prefer <hi>Eusebia,</hi> the Queen-Dowager that was to be, a Woman of exquisite Beauty, before her. A Copy of this Letter her Maid carried privily to Court, whereby the whole De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign came to light, for which both <hi>Barbatio</hi> and his Wife died, and several others were rack'd as accomplices in the Treason. And then for <hi>Julian, Constantius</hi> had for some time suspected him of hatching ill Designs, and knew that his chief Converse was with this sort of Men, who, by all the little insinuations of their Art, endeavour'd to push forward his youthful Ambition. He always kept a company of Magicians about him, who went in the habit, and under the notion, of Philosophers, and sent for a famous Pagan Priest out of <hi>Greece,</hi> with whom alone he used to spend some time, and transact some Affairs in private, just before he broke out into an open Rebellion against <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantius.</hi> These things every day more and more alarm'd the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours suspicions, and awaken'd his severity against these Men, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially after he understood that there was a mighty concourse to<note n="h" place="margin">Am.

The Emperour began to suspect his Inclinations, and therefore gave particular Charge, that he should hold no Correspondence with <hi>Libanius,</hi> a famous Orator, but a profess'd zealous Pagan, who having been forc'd to quit <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> had open'd a School at <hi>Nicomedia.</hi> But 'tis hard to chain up natural Inclinations, tho the Emperour had commanded, and his Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor <hi>Mardonius</hi> had engag'd him by Oaths to have nothing to do with <hi>Libanius,</hi> he could not wholly contain himself. He did not indeed personally Converse with him, but a way was found out, whereby his Orations and Speeches were by a secret Messenger convey'd to him every day, which he read with infinite greediness and delight, and laid before him as a Copy for his imitation. The news of his coming to <hi>Nicomedia</hi> brought thither <hi>Maximus,</hi> one of the greatest Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers of that Age, who, under pretence of teaching him Philosophy, confirm'd him in his love of Paganism, and his spleen against Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity: And being a Man famous for Magic, blew him up into a belief of the common report, that he should one day be Emperour, which so endear'd the Man to him, that he took him into his most intimate friendship, and accounted him one of the most valuable Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings of his Life.</p>
                     <p n="2">II.

Nay, so far did his disguis'd Zeal extend, that he pretended a passionate Honour and Reverence for the Martyrs, and joyn'd with his Brother <hi>Gallus</hi> to erect a stately Oratory to the memory of S. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> the Martyr, the one undertaking one part of the Work, and the
<pb n="xxviii" facs="tcp:49523:41"/> other the other. But God disdain'd that either himself or his Servants should be honour'd with such thick and damnable Hypocrisy, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly gave testimony from Heaven against it: For when that part of the Church which <hi>Gallus</hi> had undertaken went up apace, and pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd, that of <hi>Julian</hi> could take no effect; in some places the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations could not be laid, the Earth throwing up the Stones again; in others, where 'twas built up to any height, it was immediately shat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd, and tumbled to the ground. An accident that administred great variety of Discourse, and made man presage what would be the event and issue of things. However, he kept himself upon his Guard, tho he could not forbear, where he knew his Company, to open and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>close the Secrets of his Mind; and many times in discourse<note n="q" place="margin">Naz. ibid. p. <hi>61.</hi>
                        </note> with his Brother <hi>Gallus,</hi> he would take upon him very eagerly to defend the cause of supprest Paganism, wherein tho he pretended to manage the cause only by way of disputation, yet the warmth of his Temper, and the strength and seriousness of his Arguments, sufficiently shew'd he did it <hi>ex animo,</hi> what colour soever he otherwise put upon it. And his Practice was accordingly: For whatever he made the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, he equally divided his time between Study and Idolatry, study<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all day, and sacrificing at night. And the thing is confess'd by one of his dearest friends,<note n="r" place="margin">Liban. Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taph. in Jul. nec. p. <hi>265.</hi>

                        </gap>, but he thought good to dissemble, and for the present to steer the safest Course. While in truth it almost broke his Heart<note n="s" place="margin">Id. ib. p. <hi>266.</hi>
                        </note> to see the Temples desolate, the Sacrifices forbidden and neglected, the Altars and Victims taken away, the Priests banish'd, and the Revenues of the Temples shar'd among the Impure and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane. And, if we may believe <hi>Libanius,</hi> it was not Pleasure or Power, Grandeur and Dominion, made him affect the Empire, but only to have an opportunity to restore the Worship of the Gods. But this, as yet, he kept to himself, waiting a more favourable season wherein to declare himself. This hypocritical Garb he wore about him 'till he was twenty years old, when he put it off by degrees. He left <hi>Nicodmeia,</hi> and retir'd to some little part of his paternal Estate in <hi>Asia,</hi> for the far greatest part had been confiscated by <hi>Constantius.</hi> But finding the Times growing troublesom and dangerous, by mediation of the Empress, who always stood his friend, he got leave to go to <hi>Athens,</hi> under pretence to perfect his Studies, but indeed to enjoy the Company of Philosophers and Pagan Priests, and to consult more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely about future Events. And he wanted not enough of that Tribe to attend him, nay he frequented the most celebrated<note n="t" place="margin">Theod. l. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>3.</hi> p. <hi>126.</hi>
                        </note> Oracles in <hi>Greece.</hi> Among the rest he met with a Priest, who seem'd more peculiarly for his turn: The Priest brought him to the Temple, and carrying him into the innermost Retirements, began to conjure up the <hi>Daemons</hi> about him. <hi>Julian</hi> was affrighted at the sudden and horrid Appearance, and in that amazement sign'd himself with the sign of the Cross, whereat the <hi>Daemons</hi> immediately vanish'd. The Priest was angry, and severely chid him, and withall told him, that the

                        <hi>Daemons</hi> had fled not because they were afraid of the Cross, but because they were angry at his making use of that detestable Sign. And so the Contest ended, and the Priest initiated him in those solemn Rites and Mysteries.</p>

The warrant of so great an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample made the <hi>Gentiles</hi> unmeasurably insolent in every place, so that not content with leave to celebrate their impious Mysteries, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan<note n="n" place="margin">Theod. l. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>6.</hi> p <hi>129.</hi>

And when with much greater advantage the Christians paid them home in their own kind, they burst out into a rage, and with blows and wounds fell foul upon them, the Emperour in the mean time conniving at what was done. In short, he recall'd the Laws lately made against Pagan Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition, and confirm'd the ancient Edicts of his Predecessors that had been made in favour of them. And here perhaps 'twill be no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceptable entertainment to the Reader, to present him with some of the principal methods <hi>Julian</hi> made use of for the supporting Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism, and the suppressing Christianity.</p>

AND first, he set himself to reform Paganism, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of it, from the more gross Corruptions, and to introduce many wise and excellent Institutions, which he observ'd among the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians. The faults and follies of the <hi>Gentile</hi> World were so conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous in themselves, and had been so often expos'd by Christians, that they lay open to every Eye. And he had no way to recover his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion into any credit, but by retrenching what was so very scandalous and offensive, and planting what was more useful and excellent in the room of it. Earnestly therefore, and with great importunity, he press'd,<note n="o" place="margin">Fragm. Epist. p. <hi>529.</hi> &amp;c.</note> that Magistrates would take care, that Men liv'd justly and according to the Laws, and express'd a great Piety towards the Gods, and Humanity towards Men, that they would correct Men only in order to their Reformation, and relieve the Necessities they lie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as the Gods do ours; that this was the best and noblest quality, and that which did most recommend us to the favour of the Gods, who could not but be pleased with what was most agreeable to their own nature, and would certainly reward it, seeing no Man was ever made poor by his Charity; and he himself had often found, that the more he had given this way, the more he had receiv'd from Heaven; that our bounty to the Poor ought not to be stinted or limited, all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind is a kin to us, whether we will or no, and we derive our Pedigree from one common Original, and accordingly ought liberally to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to the needs of all, even to the worst of Men, and our grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Enemies, (it being the Men we are to relieve, and not their Vices) but more especially to the Good and Vertuous. That<note n="p" place="margin">Ib. p. <hi>536.</hi> &amp;c.</note> being train'd up in, and acted by these generous Principles, every Man should strive to be pious towards the Gods, kind to Men, chast and regular in their own Persons, and conversant in all the duties and offices of Religion; especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally that he should always entertain in his Mind sacred and venerable ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions of the Gods, and with sanctity and honour approach their Temples, and adore their Statues and Images, as if we beheld them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves present before our Eyes: For we were not to look upon Altars and Images as Gods, (the Gods being incorporeal, and in themselves needing no Sacrifices) but as Symbols and Representations of the Divine Presence, and as means and instruments by which we might pay our Adoration to them. And because nothing tended more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to secure the Honour and Interest of Religion, than a just Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect and Reverence towards those who attend the Ministeries and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities of it, he thought it highly reasonable,<note n="q" place="margin">Ib. p. <hi>542</hi> &amp;c.</note> that the Priests should be honour'd equally with, or rather above the Civil Magistrates, as being the Domesties of Heaven, our common Intercessors with the Gods, and the means of deriving down their Blessings upon the World. And so long as they retain'd this Relation, they were to be treated with a reverence due to their Function, but if debauch'd and vicious, they should be depos'd, and turn'd out. Persons invested with this Office, were to undertake<note n="r" place="margin">Ib. p. <hi>547</hi> &amp;c.</note> as Sureties for the honour of the Gods, and should behave themselves so, that their Lives might be a Copy and Pattern of what they were to preach to Men: That to this end, they should engage in all acts of Worship with a mighty awe and dread, and abstain not only from all vile and wicked Actions, but Words also, yea, from listning to any such Discourses, from all scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous and abusive Jests, all filthy and impure Converse; that they
<pb n="xxxiii" facs="tcp:49523:43"/> should read no idle Books, trifling Pamphlets, or loose wanton Plays, but seriously apply themselves to the study of that divine Philosophy, which was most apt to beget a great sense of God upon Mens Minds, and to learn by heart the Hymns that were to be sung in praise of the Gods, to whom they were both publicly and privately to put up their Supplications at least thrice a day, however, that nothing less than Morning and Evening should serve the turn, that every Priest in the course of his waiting should intirely attend upon it, and never depart out of the Temple, but give himself up to Philosophie Thoughts, and a careful discharge of the Duties of that place; and when his time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pir'd, and he was to return home, he converse with none but the best and most select Company, seldom go into the <hi>Forum,</hi> or approach the Houses of great Men, unless in cases that concern'd his Office, and when he might be helpful to the Poor and Indigent; to be habited when he went abroad in a plain decent Garb, and different from what he wears in his Ministration in the Temple, that in no case they should frequent the <hi>Theaters,</hi> or exhibit any obscene Sports or Shows in their own Houses, which he wish'd were reform'd, or quite taken away, but since there was little hopes of that, that the Priests at least should abstain from all such Theatrical Impurities, and leave them to the people, and be so careful of their Converse, as not to be seen in the company and familiarity of a <hi>Charioteer,</hi> or any Player or Dancer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the <hi>Theater.</hi> Lastly, that in every City they ought to be chosen out of the best, the most religious and charitable Persons, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any consideration whether they be rich or poor, external circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances not being to be regarded in this matter. 'Twas enough if the person was endu'd with Piety to God, and Humanity to Men. An evidence of the first whereof it would be, if he train'd up his Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stics and Relatives in the same paths of Piety: Of the latter, if out of that little which he has, he freely distributes to the Indigent, and does good to as many as he can. And the neglect of this, he tells them, was that which gave opportunity to the wicked <hi>Galilaeans</hi> by their singular Humanity and Charity, to strengthen and establish their pernicious Party, and pervert honest-minded <hi>Gentiles</hi> to their Impiety.</p>

                           <p>THat the Gentile-Religion does not as yet go on according to our desire and expectation, is the fault of those that do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess it: For what has been done in reference to the Gods is splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did and magnificent, and great beyond either our desires or hopes. For (with reverence to the Iustice of the Divine Providence be it spoken) to bring about such and so great a change in so short a time, was more than any Man a little while since durst so much as wish for. What then? Shall we acquiesce here, and think these things enough, and not rather cast our Eyes upon those things that have advanc'd the impious Religion of the Christians? I mean, their kindness and compassion to Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, their diligent care in burying the Dead, and that feigned seriousness and gravity that appears in their whole carriage; all which, I am of opinion, we ought really to put in practice. Nor is it enough that you alone are thus qualified, but all the Priests in <hi>Galatia</hi> ought to be altogether such: And to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose either shame, or persuade them into it, or remove them from their Sacerdotal Function, unless, together with their Wives, Children, and Servants, they studiously apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the worship of the Gods, not suffering their Servants, Children, or Wives, to be <hi>Galilaeans,</hi> who are despisers of the Gods, and prefer Impiety before Religion. Moreover, warn every Priest that he go not to the <hi>Theater,</hi> nor sit drinking in Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns, nor apply himself to any mean sordid Trade. Those that comply, give them honour and respect; those that continue obstinate, turn them out. Appoint several Hospitals for poor Travellers in every City, that indigent Strangers, not of ours only, but of any other way, may enjoy the benefit of our Grace and Charity. For the defraying which Expences, I have now made provision; for I have order'd thirty thousand <hi>Modii</hi> (or Bushels) of Wheat to be yearly distributed throughout <hi>Galatia,</hi> and sixty thousand Quarts of Wine: A fifth part whereof I will have allow'd to the poor Officers that wait upon the Priests, the remainder you shall distribute among the Poor and Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: For it were a great shame, that when none of the <hi>Jews</hi> go a begging, and when the wretched <hi>Galilaeans</hi> relieve not only their own, but ours too, that our Poor only should be deserted by us, and left naked and helpless. Wherefore admonish and instruct the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that they contribute liberally to these Services, and that every Village dedicate their first Fruits to the Gods. Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom them to this kind of Benevolence, and shew them that this has of old been practised among us. For so <hi>Homer</hi> brings in <hi>Eumaeus</hi> speaking thus:

If I hear you shall bring these things about, I shall rejoyce exceedingly. Go but seldom to the Governours Houses, but write often to them. When they make their entrance into any City, let no Priest go out to meet them; if they come to the Temples, let him only meet them in the Porch; and when they enter in, let no Officer go before them, but as many as will may follow after, for no sooner does any one set his Foot over the Threshold of that place, but he becomes a private Man, equal with the rest. For your self, you know, are sole Commander there, according to Divine Constitutions.

                     <p>By this design'd Reformation, and which, had he liv'd, he would no doubt in a great measure have accomplish'd, he hop'd to render his Religion so amiable in the Eyes of Christians, as easily to bring them over to it, at least he should throw out of the way those popular Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections that were commonly made against it.</p>
                     <p n="7">VII. SECONDLY, he took all occasions of exposing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, and making them and their Religion appear ridiculous to the World. He was a Man of great Wit, and his Wit particularly set to a sharp and sarcastic Edge, and he principally turn'd it this way. He read the Scriptures for no other end but to cavil or confute them, to pick out, as he thought, the most obnoxious passages, which he first dress'd up according to his own humour, and then derided them, and set them up for others to laugh at. If he met with a seeming con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, he made it real; if with an hyperbolical expression, he improv'd it into Blasphemy, and would run it down as inconsistent
<pb n="xxxvi" facs="tcp:49523:45"/> with the Dictates of infinite Wisdom. He scorn'd the simplicity of the Apostles and Prophets, whom he represented as a pack of ignorant and illiterate fellows, that had no Breeding and Education, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood little beyond the Shop, or a Trade. He carp'd at them almost in every Epistle, and in his <hi>Persian</hi> Expedition wrote seven whole Books in confutation of Christianity, which were afterwards solidly and fully answer'd by S. <hi>Cyrill</hi> of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> When he spake at any time of our Saviour, he would give him no other Title than the <hi>Son of Mary,</hi> or the <hi>Galilaean,</hi> and by a particular Law<note n="u" place="margin">Naz. ibid. p. <hi>81.</hi>

And his Collegue <hi>Faelix,</hi> Keeper of the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Treasures, and who in compliance with the Emperour, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd his Christianity, taking up the noble and magnificent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion Plate, which the Piety of the former Emperours had bestow'd upon the Church, <hi>See</hi> (said he in a scorn) <hi>in what brave Cups and Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels the Son of Mary is serv'd.</hi> But behold the Justice of the Divine Providence, that immediately overtook these blasphemous Miscreants. <hi>Julian</hi> was seiz'd with a miserable Distemper, his Bowels rotted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him, and his very Excrements flow'd out of his prophane Mouth, and after having lien forty days together under the most unconcei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable torments of the Bowels, he breath'd out his miserable Soul; tho before his Death his Lady, a pious and vertuous Christian, had brought him to so great a sence of his Sin, that he petition'd the Emperour in the behalf of the Christians. <hi>Faelix</hi> had a quicker Execution, for one of the Master-Veins breaking, all the Blood in his Body emptied it self out at his Mouth, to the horrour and amazement of all that saw it, and in less than a days time he vomited up his Blood and his Soul toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But to return to the Emperour, who catch'd at all advantages of deriding whatever had any relation to Christianity: And because he knew how just a Reverence the Christians paid to the memory of the great <hi>Constantine</hi> for being the first open Patron of Christianity, he traduc'd him at every turn, and in the conclusion of his <hi>Caesars,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents him as a person notoriously guilty of the most scandalous Effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minacy and Debauchery, with other Vices as falsly as spitefully charg'd upon him; and indeed hooks in all occasions to bespatter and reproach him. And in the same place he proclaims the Christian Religion to be little else but a Receptacle and Sanctuary for Rogues and Villains, where the vilest of Men might shelter themselves, and tho guilty of the most enormous Crimes, might upon a little trifling Pennance be <hi>toties quoties,</hi> in a moment made pure and clean. This he thought
<pb n="xxxvii" facs="tcp:49523:45"/> must needs render it cheap and ridiculous to all wise and considering Men, and if he did not laugh Christians out of their Religion, he should however confirm the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in his own.</p>
                     <p n="8">VIII. THIRDLY, he sought by all ways to bring Christians low, and to weaken and destroy their Power and Interest: To this end, <hi>First,</hi> He banish'd them out of all places<note n="z" place="margin">Soz. l. <hi>5.</hi> c. <hi>18.</hi> p. <hi>623.</hi> Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soft.

If they complied with the first, he had his ends, and they fell under the reproachful Character of persons, who lov'd their Places better than their Consciences, and preferr'd an empty Honour before their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; if they laid them down, he was rid of so many potent and dangerous Enemies, who might head a Party to oppose his Designs, or at least encourage the common sort of Christians to stand to their Religion with a firmer constancy and resolution. Thus among others, <hi>Valentinian,</hi> who was afterwards Emperour, generously threw up his place of <hi>Collonel</hi> of one part of the Guards of the Palace, and submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the sentence of Banishment, rather than he would come under the least shadow of an Idolatrous Compliance, whereof more in its proper place. And not content with this, where any had been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in the Reigns of the preceding Emperours, in demolishing Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Altars, pulling down Temples, taking away their Ornaments, or the like, he not only stript them of their Honours and Priviledges, but suffer'd them to be indicted, condemned, and executed, where a bare Accusation, was many times proof enough. <hi>Secondly,</hi> He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted unreasonable sums of Money from them on all occasions, that being impoverish'd, they might either lie under a strong temptation to Apostacy, or be secur'd from attempting any thing against the Civil State. Hence the Fines, Penalties, and Confiscations, that sill'd his Reign, any pretence serving to start a Title to their Estates. If a Man was but suspected to have enrich'd himself by any Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues formerly belonging to Heathen Temples, he was presently brought into the Exchequer, and right or wrong forc'd to refund: If guilty of the least Mutiny or Riot, their Purses were sure to smart for it. Thus when the <hi>Arians</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">Jul. Epist. XLIII. p. <hi>196.</hi>
                        </note> at <hi>Edessa</hi> had fallen foul upon the <hi>Valenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Heretics, he presently seiz'd the Treasures of that Church, which he bestow'd upon his Soldiers, and the Lands, which he appropriated to his own use, jeering them into the bargain, that he did but herein deal with them according to the admirable Law of their own Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, ease them of their Burden, that they might go so much the lighter unto the Kingdom of Heaven, and that being made poor, they might become wise, and not fall short of that heavenly Kingdom they so greedily expected. But nothing serv'd him to better purpose than his War against <hi>Persia,</hi> under pretence<note n="b" place="margin">Niceph. l. <hi>10.</hi> c. <hi>24.</hi> p. <hi>53.</hi>
                        </note> whereof he amass'd infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Treasures, imposing a heavy pecuniary Mulct upon the Heads of all those that refus'd to offer Sacrifice to the Gods. The Edict was executed with merciless severity, yea even upon those who had nothing to pay: Nay, the Commanders and Officers stretch'd it beyond its natural intention, extorting greater sums than the Edict had impos'd, beating and abusing them that refus'd to pay. And when the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians complain'd to him of the Oppressions and Injuries which in this case the Governours of Provinces put upon them, all the Redress they
<pb n="xxxviii" facs="tcp:49523:46"/> could get, was a Sarcasm tart enough, <hi>Your Christ</hi> (said he) <hi>has given you a Law, that when you suffer unjustly, you should bear it resolutely; and when oppress'd and injur'd, should not answer again. Thirdly,</hi> He studied to set them a clashing and quarrelling with one another, that he might do his work with their hands. The politic Prince remember'd the old Maxim, <hi>Divide, and govern;</hi> 'twas but setting them together by the Ears, and they would ruine themselves. He was not ignorant what powerful Factions there were among them, what implacable Feuds and Animosities had been exercis'd between several Parties in the times of his Predecessors; he knew these bitter Contentions were not forgotten, and that they would return to them with fresh, and perhaps more eager Appetites.

                        </note> whom he gave leave to return to their Sees, possess'd by those, who he knew would not easily part with them. And tho to gain himself the Reputation of a wise and merciful Prince, he sent for the Bishops and their people to Court, and press'd them to concord, and that every one would peaceably enjoy the freedom of his own way, yet the design at the bottom was plainly this, that he might set them a wrangling more effectually, and that the liberty he gave them might widen and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease their Dissentions, that so they might be incapable of confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting into any dangerous and formidable Combinations, as is confess'd by his own Historian.<note n="d" place="margin">Am.

And notwithstanding their madness and folly had almost ruin'd all, yet the worst he had done them was, that in his esteem and choice of Persons, he had preferr'd pious and good Men before them: And one of his greatest Advocates<note n="k" place="margin">Liban.

Besides, he considered, that all the methods of Rage and Flerceness would never compass or attain his ends; he might put the World into a Flame and a Combustion, but he could never drive the Christians out of it, nor force them to be of his mind; their Religion might be shaken, but it would take deeper Root. He had observ'd<note n="l" place="margin">Chrys. loc. supr. citat. Sozom. ib. c. <hi>4.</hi> p. <hi>599.</hi> Naz. ubi supr. p. <hi>72.</hi>
                        </note> the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy miscarriages of his Pagan Predecessors, who by sanguinary Laws, and rigorous Proceedings, had been so far from extinguishing Christianity, that they had spread it through the World, and that the Churches Field was never more fruitful, than when water'd with the Blood of Martyrs, who grew up thicker the faster they were mow'd down. Great and generous Minds are not easily daunted with oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, but grow up thereby into a more manly Courage and Resolution, In the midst of all their spite and cruelty Christians could court the Stake and the Flames, the Sword and the Rack, and their Persecutors sometimes had enough to do to keep them from pressing on to an Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and people could not but enquire into, admire, and embrace that Religion, which supported and invigorated the Minds of its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors, and made them triumph in the midst of those Sufferings, which were beyond all the Powers of humane Nature to bear up under. The same Spirit he saw continued still, and Christians were as ready as their Enemies, and to use his own expression, <hi>Give them but occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and they'l crowd as fast to Martyrdom, as Bees swarm to their Hives.</hi> But he would not gratifie them in that, tho it had been so dearly to their cost; he envied them the honour of Martyrdom, a thing he found they so eagerly desired, and valued beyond all the conveniencies of Life, or the enjoyments and advantages of this World. And if any died in defence of their Religion, he commanded they should not be accounted Martyrs, and that they should be thought to dye for any Crimes, rather than upon the account of Religion. For these reasons he laid aside all thoughts of a public and general Persecution, which would have made him and his Party so much the more odious, and them more great and venerable. But tho no public Warrants were issued out, he left his Commanders and Governours to use their discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, especially in those places that were far from Court, who were not backward to improve their Authority and Power.

This had been an old trick, and vigorously attempted in all Ages by the great Enemy of Mankind; 'twas but for the Wolf to persuade the Flock they had no need of a Shepherd, and his work was done. The Clergy have always been the great Eye-sore to Men of pernicious and atheistical Principles, whose desperate Designs they have strenuously oppos'd and countermin'd, and could never be brought to be content, that the World should be over-run with Atheism and Impiety, and the people moulded into any shape, and thereby betray the Souls committed to their charge. This, whatever may be pretended, is the true source and original of all that Spite and Malice they are encounter'd with by Men of bad Minds, and of all those hard Names and characters of Reproach to this day fix'd upon them by an ingrateful and degenerate World. <hi>Julian</hi> preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,<note n="p" place="margin">Soz. l. <hi>5.</hi> c. <hi>15.</hi> p. <hi>616.</hi> Jul.

To compass this more effectually, he first seiz'd their Incomes, and took away their allowances of Corn; next, he abrogated their Immunities; and whereas by the favour of former Princes they had been exempt from being of the <hi>Curiales,</hi> he repeal'd these Laws, and made them liable to the burdens and offices of the Civil Courts, especially where any of them had been ordain'd out of that Body: And when this would not do, he endeavour'd to remove and drive them away by fraud or force. At <hi>Antioch</hi> the Churches were shut up, the Plate and Treasures seiz'd into the Exchequer, and the Clergy forc'd to fly.

SIXTHLY, he gave all manner of assistance and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to the <hi>Jews,</hi> meerly in spite and opposition to the Christians: And herein we have a notorious Instance how far Malice will stoop to serve its ends. <hi>Julian</hi> hated the <hi>Jews</hi> almost equally with the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, and yet when he found they were likely to be proper Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to his purpose, he spake tenderly of them, pittied their mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and afflicted State, desired their Prayers in his <hi>Persian</hi> Wars, releas'd the Tribute put them upon, and press'd them to the rebuil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their Temple, re-edifying their Altar, and restoring their Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and the Solemnities of their Worship. In order whereunto he sent them a Commission, allow'd the charges of the Work out of his own Exchequer, and appointed Officers to superintend it, and that the Governour of the Province should aid and assist them in it. Two things especially he propounded to himself in this: <hi>First,</hi> That by thus obliging the <hi>Jews,</hi> he should be the better able to bring them over to his own Religion; or however that went, should thrust an incurable Thorn into the sides of Christians. He was not to be told what an inveterate and implacable Enmity the <hi>Jews</hi> bare to Christians, and that being now back'd with the Royal Authority, they would not only reproach and bespatter, but oppress and trample upon them, and pursue them with the utmost violence of a fierce and ungovernable Zeal. <hi>Secondly,</hi> He hop'd by restoring the Temple and legal Worship, to evidence to the World, that our Saviour was an Impostor and false Prophet, who had so expresly foretold the final and irrevocable disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of that Church and State. So the work was carried on with all possible briskness and activity, and nothing was thought of but Feasts and Triumphs, when Heaven on a sudden baffled the whole Enterprize, and many illustrious and miraculous Appearances of the Divine Vengeance forc'd the Workmen to sit down, and give over in Despair; and what the Emperour design'd as a way to suppress, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a means to advance Christianity, no inconsiderable number being hereby brought over to the Christian Faith.

It griev'd him to see the Christian Faith so largely spread, so firmly rooted, and so many excellent Books written, either in defence, or explication of it; and he sticks not to tell<note n="z" place="margin">Epist.

                        </note> us, he heartily wish'd all Writings that concern'd the Doctrine of the wicked <hi>Galilaeans,</hi> were quite banish'd out of the World. But because there were no hopes of that, he encourag'd all the Sophists, Philosophers, and Orators, that he could meet with, to bend their Wits and Studies this way; whom he resetled in their own Countries and Possessions, allow'd them Pensions, and peculiar Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, and indeed whatever they could reasonably desire or expect from him. This fill'd all Schools and Colleges, all Courts and Corners with Lectures, Invectives, and Declamations against Christians. This made the philosophising Trade go on apace, every one desiring to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the Emperour's humour, though a great part of them had little more of the Philosopher in them,<note place="margin">Vid.

And these being the Men that were generally intrusted with the education of Youth, and who govern'd and directed the Minds and Consciences of the people, he was sure of so many sworn Enemies to Christianity, who would not fail to lay out all their Talents and Abilities that way. And the truth is, if Wit, or Learning, or Eloquence, could have done it, he had certainly driven it out of the World. But <hi>the foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God is wiser than Men, and his weakness stronger than Men,</hi> who baffled all their tricks of Artifice and Subtlety, and <hi>made foolish the Wisdom of this World.</hi>

Of this, a few Instances shall suffice. He used to place the Images<note n="a" place="margin">Soz. ib. c. <hi>17.</hi> p. <hi>621.</hi> Naz. ib p. <hi>74</hi> &amp; <hi>83.</hi>

When the Soldiers came at the solemn times to receive their Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, the ancient usage was at the same time to throw a piece of Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kincense into the Fire in honour of the Gods, which tho the Christians generally detested, yet some few, surpriz'd thereinto by an inveterate custom, did it. But being minded afterwards of what they had done, such an honour seiz'd upon their Consciences, that they run up and down like mad Men, went to the Emperour, and threw back their Donatives, publicly professing themselves Christians, and desiring they might dye to give testimony to their Religion. At other times he would defile<note n="b" place="margin">Theod. l. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>15.</hi> p. <hi>137.</hi> Chrysost. Orat. in Juvent. &amp; Max.

The Christians resented it with a just indignation, tho they knew withall, S. <hi>Paul</hi> had long since deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd this case. Upon this occasion <hi>Juventinus</hi> and <hi>Maximus,</hi> two Officers in the Imperial Guards, express'd a vehement dislike of the Emperour's action, with a tart reflection upon his Apostacy. For which, being summon'd and examin'd, they plainly told him, <hi>Sir, we have been educated in the true Religion, and having submitted to those excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Laws establish'd by</hi> Constantine <hi>and his Children, cannot but now bewail the Abominations which we see you cast about in every place, while you pollute both Meat and Drink with impure filthy Sacrifices. These are the things we lament and complain of, both at home, and now again in your presence, and mourn under as the great blemish of your Raign. Julian,</hi> notwithstanding all his Gravity and Philosophical Attainments, was so netled at this Answer, that he could not pass it over, but comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to be first miserably tortured, and then put to death.

The Emperour was highly offended, and expostulated sharply with the Senate, that in such a City there should be found so much Irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Gods, beyond what was to be met with in the most bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Corner of the Empire; and that being so rich, they should not afford one little Bird for sacrifice, when every Ward might have brought an Oxe, much more the whole City joyn'd together; that they spar'd no cost in their private Feasts and Entertainments, while they gave not a penny to any public or private Sacrifice, but suffered their Wives to enrich the <hi>Galilaeans,</hi> and throw away their Estates upon their Poor; there was none of them but would celebrate their own Birth-days with all imaginable pomp and plenty, when they would not bestow a little Oyl for the Lamps, not a piece of Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense, nor the smallest Oblation upon the Solemnities of the Gods.

Hereupon the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders withdrew, and brought nothing to Market, and so a real Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine ensued. This put the people into a Mutiny, who charg'd the fault upon the Emperour, and according to the humour of that place pelted him with satyrical Reflections, especially playing upon his long rough and ill-shap'd Beard; for which they call'd him a <hi>Goat,</hi> and usually said, 'twas good for nothing but to be shav'd off, and to make Ropes of it.

Winter being over, he departed with his Army from <hi>Antioch</hi> the first of <hi>March,</hi> and at his going out, to let them understand how much he resented the Affronts they had put upon him, told them, by a fatal prognostication, that he would never see them more: And the<note n="k" place="margin">Theod. lib. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>23.</hi> p. <hi>145.</hi>
                        </note> story is commonly known, that when <hi>Julian</hi> march'd out with a great pomp and train, and had spoken big words of what he would do to the Christians at his return, <hi>Libanius,</hi> to add the greater scorn and reproach to them, ask'd a Christian School-man of his acquaintance at <hi>Antioch, what the Carpenter's Son was now doing?</hi> meaning our ever blessed Saviour.

He told them, that the Wild-Boar that had wasted the Lord's Vineyard had now paid for all the Injuries he had done to it, that he lay dead upon the ground, incapable of doing it any farther harm.

He was <hi>Primicerius</hi> of the <hi>Domestical Protectors,</hi> or Captain General of the Imperial Guards, a firm and resolv'd Christian, in so much that when <hi>Julian</hi> publish'd an Edict, that the Army should either sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice or disband, he presently offered to lay down his Arms; but the Emperour knew him to be too considerable a Person, to be easily parted with, and therefore continued him in his Command. Upon the shouts and acclamations of the Soldiers he bluntly told them, That he for his part was a Christian, and could not take upon him the Command of those Men, or the Conduct of that Army, that had been trained up in the impious Principles of the deceased Emperour; nor could he expect any Success from their Arms, who being destitute of the divine Blessing and Protection, must needs become a Prey and Derision to their Enemies. To this they almost unanimously replied, <q>Make no scruple, Sir, to venture upon the Empire, nor let the Impiety of our Principles be an Argument with you to decline it. For you will reign over Christians, Men instructed in the Laws of Piety: Those of us that are eldest, were brought up under the Institution and Discipline of <hi>Constantine;</hi> those that are next, under the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions of <hi>Constantius;</hi> and for the late Emperour, his Reign was so short, that it was not capable of making any deep Impression upon the Minds of Men.</q> Upon this assurance, he took the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon him, and made Peace with the <hi>Persians</hi> upon the best Terms that those evil Circumstances they were under could admit. The trouble which the <hi>Gentiles</hi> conceiv'd for the Death of <hi>Julian</hi> was doubled upon them by the Election of <hi>Jovian,</hi> whose Zeal for Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity they were too well assur'd of, and therefore in all places tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd

                     <p n="2">II. HE began his Reign, as became a wise and good Prince, with the Care of Religion.

He restor'd to the several Churches the Gifts and Revenues, and to the Clergy, and those who liv'd within the verge of it, the Privileges and Immunities which <hi>Julian</hi> had taken from them, particularly he restor'd the <hi>Corn-Canon,</hi> (as they call'd it) the yearly Allowance of Corn, which <hi>Constantine</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> had settled upon the Church, and which the late Emperour had abolish'd. But because a great Dearth rag'd at that time, he was forc'd for the present to cut off two thirds of that Tribute, promising to restore it intire as soon as the Famine was over, and would no doubt have made good his word, had God spar'd his Life. He also recall'd all those, both ecclesiastic and secular Persons, that in the late times had been banish'd for their Religion. The Pagan Temples he commanded to be shut up, and the public Sacrifices to be taken away; whereupon the Priests crept into Corners, and the very Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers were so frighted that they laid aside the <hi>Pallium,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited themselves according to the common Garb. But this I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive they did more out of fear of the Christians upon this great Turn of Affairs, than any positive Constitution of the Emperour to that purpose. For where-ever he came, he kindly receiv'd, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably entertain'd the Philosophers, and by an Edict<note n="f" place="margin">Vid. Themist. Orat. XII. pag. <hi>278.</hi>
                        </note> gave every man leave to serve God in his own way, which I understand not of the public but private Exercise of Religion. By this time he was entred upon his Consulship, and being arriv'd at <hi>Ancyra</hi> in <hi>Galatia,</hi> was met by <hi>Themistius</hi> the Philosopher, with some others of the Senatorian Order, where <hi>Themistius</hi> in an elegant Oration<note n="g" place="margin">Orat. supr. cit.</note> congratulated him for his new Honour and Dignity, and at large gives him his just com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, especially for his compassion to the afflicted and banished, and his admirable care of Religion, his great Indulgence towards all, in leaving every one to the freedom of his own choice, and herein imitating God, who having planted in Mens Minds a natural Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Religion, has left every Man free to chuse that way and means wherein he may best express it: Princes might compel to the outward Act, but the Mind was above all Warrants or Threat'nings; Force may make Men Hypocrites, but not Religious; and to worship the Imperial Purple, not the Deity. Thence that unsteadiness and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancy that is in such Mens profession, for the force being taken off, they fluctuate to this or that, and change their Religion oft'ner than <hi>Euripus</hi> Ebbs and Flows. An Argument, which he there manages with all the advantages of a smooth, plausible, and rhetorical Insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation. And 'twas an Argument the <hi>Gentiles</hi>

But whatever might be said for the thing it self, they forgot when this would not pass with themselves for currant Doctrine, and how miserably in former times they had treated the poor Christians, whom they had not only tempted to Apostacy by promises and perswasions, but had endeavoured to force them to abandon their Religion by all the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of the most barbarous and merciless Severities.

However 'twas, he was found dead in his Bed, after he had reign'd not full eight months.

Then a Person clad in Linnen Vestments came in with Lawrel Branches in his hand, and after some Charms performed, shak'd a Magical Ring hanging at a Curtain about the edge of the Charger, 'till by jumping up and down it sell upon such or such Letters of the Alphabet, where it seem'd to stay, the Priest there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon composing certain Heroic Verses in answer to the Interrogatories that had been put.

But it was not long before the whole Conspiracy was discovered to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, who divided between astonishment and anger commanded the business to be brought under a thorough scrutiny and examination. <hi>Theodorus</hi> was beheaded, the Maker of the <hi>Tripos</hi> burnt alive, and all the rest that were any ways concern'd in the fatal Consult exquisitly tortur'd, and then put to death, whose arraignments, racks, and severe usages, may be read at large in <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus.</hi> All Philosophers that came to hand were sure to be executed, and the Emperour, who was always cruel, was in this case outragious, not sparing any that did but go habited like Philosophers, though they addicted not themselves to those studies; a fring'd Cloke being then taken for a sufficient evidence of a Magician and a Conjurer. Among these Philosophers was <hi>Maximus, Julian</hi>'s great Master, the most celebrated Philosopher of that Age: <hi>Valens</hi> ow'd him an old grudge, for an affront he had done him and his Brother in <hi>Julian</hi>'s time, and
<pb n="lv" facs="tcp:49523:54"/> therefore in the beginning of his Reign had treated him with those exquisite severities, which <hi>Eunapius</hi> so tragically complains of; and being now charg'd with being privy to the Plot, though he only knew of it, and told the Conspirators they would all come to an untimely end, was carried to <hi>Ephesus,</hi> the place of his Nativity, and there beheaded. But above all others, the Emperour's fury rag'd against those, whose Names began with those four Letters, whether <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, Theodotus, Theodosius, Theodulus,</hi> or the like, whom he put to death where-ever he found them, by the same bloody Policy where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <hi>Herod</hi> once butchered the Infants at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> hoping that in the number he should make away the new-born <hi>Messiah,</hi> and King of the <hi>Jews.</hi> And this prosecuted with so much rigour, that many, to avoid the danger, chang'd their Names, as not being willing to lose their Lives for a malignant Name. And yet God, who delights many times to defeat Mens malicious curiosity, suffered the Great <hi>Theodosius</hi> to escape, and in despite of all his care and cruelty to succeed him in the <hi>Eastern</hi> Empire; and 'tis said, that his Parents were parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly warn'd in a Dream to give him that Name, as an <hi>Omen</hi> it seems of his after Greatness. Nor did <hi>Valens</hi> persecute Men only, but Books upon this occasion, commanding a search to be made for all Books of Magic, or any other curious or unlawful Art, which being piled upon heaps were publickly burnt. And at this time it was, that <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> then a Youth, was in some danger:<note place="margin">Hom. <hi>xxxviii.</hi> in Act. p. <hi>340.</hi>

This place <hi>Theophilus</hi> had begg'd of the Emperour, designing to enlarge it into a Church. Workmen were set on to clear the Rubbish, who found many dark Vaults and Cellers, the secret Receptacles of the Pagans most hidden Rites and Mysteries, out of which they brought many detestable and obscene Images and Utensils, which they publicly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to the scorn and derision of the People. This provok'd the <hi>Gentiles</hi> beyond measure, who immediately gather'd into a Body, and tho the far lesser number, yet being arm'd with Rage and Fury, broke in upon the Christians, wounded many of them, others they kill'd out right, and flying to the Temple, engarrison'd themselves in it. Some Christians they had taken Prisoners, and brought along with them, whom they forc'd to do Sacrifice, or upon their refusal, put to Death with the most exquisite and unheard-of Tortures. The Party was headed by one <hi>Olympus</hi> a Philosopher, who persuaded them not to desert the Religion of their Country, but if need was, valiantly to dye for it. And when he saw them dejected for the loss of their Images, he told them, They should not be troubled at this, they were indeed no other than what they saw, things material, and liable to violence and corruption, but were inhabited by certain Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Powers, which upon their defacing were retir'd into Heaven.
<pb n="lxii" facs="tcp:49523:58"/> Several Essays were made by the Magistrates to bring them to reason, and make them give account of what they had done; but in vain: They despis'd all Arguments and Threatnings, whereupon the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates were forc'd to send and acquaint the Emperour with what had happen'd, who, according to the sweetness of his Nature, reply'd, That for the Christians that had been slain, they were happy, having been honour'd with the Crown of Martyrdom; and for their Murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, he resolv'd to pardon them, in hopes, that so much Grace and Clemency might become an effectual Argument for their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: But however, that the Temples, that had been the cause of all this, should be pull'd down to the ground.

One Instance whereof must not be forgotten. <hi>Tyrannus</hi> a Priest of the Temple of <hi>Saturn,</hi> famous for giving Oracles, had his Temple frequented by persons of the best Quality about that City. When he had a mind to corrupt any of their Wives, he would tell the Nobleman, 'twas the Gods pleasure that his Wife should come and spend that nights Devotions in the Temple. The Lady was dress'd up with all advantages, and night being come, the Doors were lock'd fast upon her, and while she was intent upon her Devotions, the Priest by secret conveyances crept into the old Wormeaten Image of <hi>Saturn,</hi> through which he spake to her, as if it had been the God himself, and having thus prepar'd her, by unseen Cords suddenly put out the Lights, and then coming forth, and seizing upon the affrighted Lady, easily drew her into lewd Embraces. This Trade he had follow'd many years, 'till meeting with one that would not be for his turn, and who knew him by his voice, she complain'd of the affront to her Husband, who discover'd the Villany, brought <hi>Tyrannus</hi> to condign Punishment, and both Temple and Idol to a shameful end.

The people hereupon began to mutiny, and said, It was, because they were not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd according to their ancient usage to do Sacrifice to the River. The Governour was troubled, and fearing an open Sedition, sent to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the Emperour, who return'd this answer, That 'twas better to preserve our Duty to God, than to prefer the Streams of <hi>Nile,</hi> or the Plenty of the Country before Piety and Religion. Let the River (said he) never flow again, if it must be drawn out with Charms, appeas'd with Sacrifices, and its Waters defil'd with Blood. But the Controversy was soon ended, for the River return'd to its ancient course, and rising above the highest mark (which yet it seldom or never reach'd) put them into a quite contrary Passion, fearing it would inevitably drown the Country. And now the <hi>Pagans</hi> chang'd their Tune, and turn'd their Scene into Droll and <hi>Ridicule,</hi> crying out in their Theaters, That the old doting <hi>Nile</hi> had lost his retentive faculty, and could no longer hold his Water. While others made a more grave and serious use of it, being thereby convinc'd of the vanity of their native Superstition, and going over to Christianity.

And when afterwards upon the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the Murder, his Sons would have prosecuted and revenged his Death, the Provincial Synod would not suffer it, affirming, that both he and they, and all his Friends, had cause rather to bless God, who had counted him worthy to dye in so good a Cause.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. THIS great and general wast committed upon Paganism in the <hi>Eastern</hi> Parts, made the <hi>Gentiles</hi> look about them, in so much, that their great Advocate <hi>Libanius,</hi> one in so great favour with the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, that he made him <hi>Praetorian Praefect,</hi> about this time publish'd an Oration <hi>pro Templis,</hi> presented to <hi>Theodosius,</hi> wherein he boldly pleads the cause of their Temples, which he shews originally sprang from that Encouragement which the Gods gave to the plain but early Piety and Devotion of Mankind, and were enlarg'd and beautified according as they gain'd footing in Towns and Cities. His main busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness was to encounter the popular Arguments which the Christians used for the taking down their Temples. As, that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> made use of them for the celebration of their Sacrifices expresly contrary to the Laws. This he flatly denies, and challenges any to make it good. And whereas 'twas pretended, that in their Festival Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments they slew Oxen, he answers, 'Twas no such matter. They met indeed upon their Festival Solemnities in the open Fields, where he confesses they kill'd, drest, and eat a Calf or a Sheep, and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it with Incense, Hymns, and Invocation of their Gods, but this he says was not forbid by any Law, nor was this pulling down the Temples, as was plausibly given out, a rational means of bringing over Pagans to Christianity. He grants, it made some Hypocrites, none true Converts. Many through fear might go to the Christian Churches, and compose themselves after their Forms and Gestures, but when they did so, either worship'd their own Gods, or none at all. Besides, that Religion was to be planted in Men's minds by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and Persuasion, not by Force or Fear. And whereas 'twas com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly urg'd, that this destruction tended plainly to the advantage and benefit of the World, he endeavours to shew, that the favouring and protecting that Religion had in all Ages entail'd the greatest Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings from Heaven upon the Civil State, and most immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the Grandeur and Majesty of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. Nor had the Christians, he says, any reason to pretend, they did this in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
<pb n="lxv" facs="tcp:49523:59"/> with the Zeal of <hi>Constantine</hi> and <hi>Constantius,</hi> those two Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours having been so signally punish'd for their attempts in this kind: <hi>Constantius</hi>'s Posterity being soon cut off; some of his Children came to untimely ends, and <hi>Constantius</hi> himself liv'd perpetually in a slavish fear of the <hi>Persians,</hi> and most of his Adherents (who reap'd the Spoils of the Temples) had met with some remarkable Vengeance that had overtaken them. Having urg'd this, he further back'd his Plea with two Arguments. First, that next to the Imperial Palaces, Temples were the great Glory and Ornaments of Cities, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in all good reason and policy ought not to be destroy'd. Secondly, That however that might be, yet a considerable Interest and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage might be rais'd by them; for they might be let out, and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to other uses, and the Rents of them be return'd into the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer; which was better however than pulling of them down. And because the Monks had been of all others the most active and busie in demolishing the <hi>Pagan</hi> Temples, especially those that stood in the Fields, he falls very severely upon them, traducing<note n="z" place="margin">De Templ. p. <hi>10, 11.</hi> &amp;c. &amp; p. <hi>29.</hi> Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sim. l. <hi>5.</hi> p. <hi>800.</hi> Eunap. in vit.

And that their work might be done more effectually, they had Military Offices call'd <hi>Sophronistae</hi> or <hi>Correctors</hi> to attend them, whose business it was to seize the Temples and Possessions, and who were no sooner shew'd by the Monks where to Quarry, but like <hi>Harpy</hi>'s immediately flew upon it, to the utter discouragement of the Husband-men and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-people, who plac'd all their hopes and expectations of the success and prosperity of their Labours in these opportunities of Devotion, and pledges of the favour of their Gods. And tho they had oft com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd to the Bishops of these Irregularities, yet could they find no redress, the Bishops always taking part with the Monks. This is the sum of his Discourse, and, but that <hi>Theodosius</hi> was a Prince renown'd for his Clemency, it had been prodigious impudence to have talk'd at that rate to a Christian Emperour. However it did them little good, the Process against them went on still, and the total ruine both of their Temples and Worship follow'd not long after: Which so far enrag'd that Party, that they made several attempts against the Life of that great Prince; particularly <hi>Lucius</hi> Commander of the Forces at <hi>Constantinople</hi> came into the presence, and thrice endeavour'd to draw out his Sword, with an intent to dispatch the Emperour, but espying on a sudden (as he thought) a Woman of a mighty stature, and a terrible aspect standing behind and guarding the Emperour, he departed in a great fright. The next that undertook it was the General of the Forces in the <hi>East,</hi> who riding upon this errand, fell from his Horse and broke his Thigh, and died.

But the Gentile part of them were stiff and intractable, affirming, they would not prefer a senceless and unreasonable Belief before an old warranted way of Worship, and that under the influences of this Religion their City had prosper'd for near 1200 years together, and if they should now change it for any other, they knew not what Fate might ensue upon it. <hi>Theodosius</hi> reply'd, That if they were thus obstinate, he knew no reason why he should be at the charge to maintain them in it, and would therefore withdraw the public allowances made out of the Exchequer, nay, would abolish the things themselves which he ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly dislik'd, and the charges whereof he thought it much more reasonable should be translated to encrease the Pay and Salary of the Army. The Senators reply'd, Their Sacrifices could not be duly cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated, unless Charges were allow'd out of the public Stock, and that for want hereof, and for the neglect and restraint of their ancient and paternal Rites and Ceremonies, it was, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire died by piece-meal, and was Limb after Limb pull'd in pieces, and become a prey and a possession to the barbarous Nations, and indeed its Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants so generally wasted, that it was reduc'd to a meer <hi>Sceleton,</hi> and the very Ruines of its Cities were scarce to be seen.

This it seems was a parting blow, nor do we meet with any thing farther concerning these matters in the Imperial Laws of these times, nor indeed is any thing considerable to be found in History: For partly by the clear light and conviction of the Christian Doctrine, every where plainly and constantly preach'd, partly by the force and severity of the Laws of the Empire, Heathenism dwindled into no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and that little that was left, crept into holes and corners to hide its Head, according to the prediction long since of the Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi> that <hi>the Idols should utterly be abolish'd, and should go into the Holes of the Rocks, and into the Caves of the Earth, and that Men should cast their Idols of Silver and of Gold, which they made each one for himself to worship, to the Moles, and to the Bats;</hi> fit company for such blind Idolaters. And thus we have seen how Paganism ebb'd and flow'd in the Reigns of the several Princes, after Christianity became the Religion of the Empire, 'till it was quite beaten out of Doors.

And because he foresaw it would be objected, that the wisdom here spoken of was before the rest of the Creation, he affirms, that the material World was indeed actually made before it, but that this wisdom and man as the Subject of it were first in the purpose and design of God. The particulars of the dispute are too tedious to be here inserted, he concludes with an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress to the Philosopher, not to suffer himself to be led aside out of the common road of the Apostolick Faith, to apply his mind to truth, without respect to hatred or parties, by which means he would quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly understand that the Son of God was not a Creature, but the very maker and founder of the whole Creation. Among many things that induce me to disbelieve the account of these disputations, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of this passage of <hi>Eusebius,</hi> this is not the least, the odd inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation which <hi>Eusebius</hi> here gives of this so much controverted place.

                           <p>THOƲGH I doubt not, dear Brethren, but that before this you have heard by some other hand, what things have been debated con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Faith of the Church in the great Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> since report is wont to out-run the true account of things; yet to the end that such reports may not represent things otherwise to you than indeed they are, we have thought it necessary to send you, first, the Confession of Faith, which we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, and next the other, which with some addition to ours the Synod establish'd. The form propos'd by us, and which was read in the presence of the most sacred Emperor, and seem'd to be lik'd and approv'd by all, was in this manner. <hi>The exposition of our Faith.</hi> As we have receiv'd it from the Bishops, who were our predecessors, both when we were first instructed in the rudiments of the Faith, and when afterwards baptized into it; as we have learn't from the holy Scriptures, and both believed and taught, not only when we sustain'd the Office of Presbyter, but since we came to the Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Station, so do we still believe, and produce this as the account of our Faith.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, maker of all things visible and invisible: And in one Lord <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> the Word of God, God of God, Light of Light, Life of Life, the only begotten Son, the first born of every Creature, begotten of God the Father before all Worlds; by whom all things were made, who for our Salvation was incarnate, and dwelt amongst men, he suffered, and rose again the third
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49523:70"/> day, and ascended to the Father, and shall come again with Glory to judge both the quick and the dead. We believe also in one holy Ghost. Each of these <hi>[Persons]</hi> We believe to be and to subsist, the Father tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Father, the Son truly the Son, and the holy Ghost truly the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost: As our Lord himself when he sent forth his Disciples to Preach, said to them, <hi>Go teach all Nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Ghost.</hi> Concerning which we also declare the same to be our sence, that we hold this now, that we have ever hitherto held the same, and that we shall hold it to the death, firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly persevering in this Faith, and Anathematizing every impious Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie. All which we profess before Almighty God, and our Lord <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> that we have sincerely, and from our very hearts maintain'd ever since we were capable to understand our selves, that we still do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally think and speak the same things, being ready to give you all assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and demonstration, that heretofore we have constantly so believ'd and preach'd.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Having thus declared our Faith, it met with no contradiction, yea the most holy Emperor himself first pronounc'd it to be sound and right, affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that himself was of the same mind, and exhorting all others unanimously to assent and subscribe to this Doctrine, adding only the word <hi>Consubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> to it, which also he expounded, affirming, that the Son was not said to be <hi>Consubstantial</hi> according to corporeal affections, or that he did subsist of his Father by any kind of Section or Division; it being impossible that an immaterial, intellectual and incorporeal Nature should admit any corporeal passion; but that these things were to be understood in a divine and secret way.

And in the holy Ghost. But for those that say, there was a time when he was not, or that he was not before he was, or that he was made of things that had no existence; or that affirm the Son of God to be of any other substance or essence, or that he was created, or is obnoxious to change or alteration; all such the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and Apostolick Church of God doe anathematize and reject.</hi>

                           <p>No sooner was the matter digested into this form, but we were especially careful to examine those Phrases, <hi>of the substance of the Father,</hi> and <hi>consubstantial with the Father.</hi> This begat various Questions and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers, and an accurate weighing the true importance of them. They ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49523:70"/> that these words <hi>(of the Substance)</hi> did imply, that the Son was of the Father, but not as a part of him. Which notion it seemed very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable to us to embrace, seeing the true Doctrine teaches, that the Son is of the Father, but yet no part of his Substance. Wherefore we also gave our assent to it, not rejecting the very word <hi>Consubstantial</hi> for peace sake; and that we might not decline from the right sence of things. Ʋpon the same account we approv'd those terms, <hi>begotten, not made;</hi> where they told us that <hi>(made)</hi> was a word common to all other Creatures that were made by the Son, with which the Son himself had no resemblance; that therefore he was no Creature, like to any thing made by him, but of a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance far more excellent than any created Being; which the divine Oracles teach to be of the Father, by an ineffable manner of Generation, which can neither be express'd, no nor comprehended by any created Ʋnderstanding. So likewise for this, that the Son is <hi>Consubstantial,</hi> or of the same essence with the Father, upon debate it was agreed, that this was not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood after any corporeal Mode, or the manner of mortal Creatures, it not being capable of so being either by division of the Substance, or by abscision, or by change of the essence and power of the Father, his unbegotten nature being utterly inconsistent with any one of these: But that this, that he is <hi>Consubstantial with the Father,</hi> signified no more, than that the Son of God had no kind of similitude with any Creatures, but was only, and in all things like unto this Father that begat him, not of any other subsistence or essence, but of the Father. Which being so explain'd, it seem'd very just and reasonable we should assent to it. Forasmuch as we know that some of the learned and famous Bishops and Writers of ancient times, in explaining the divinity of the Father and the Son, have us'd this word, <hi>Consubstantial.</hi> And so much for the Faith here established, to which we all consented, not rashly and inconsiderately, but in the sences alledged, discus'd before the most religious Emperor, and for the reasons above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd approv'd by all. And for the <hi>Anathema</hi> affix'd by them at the end of the Creed, we readily own it, as what prohibits men to use unscriptural terms, from whence has arisen all the confusion and disturbance in the Church. For seeing the Divinely inspired Scripture no where makes use of these expressions, <gap reason="foreign">

                              <hi>of things not existent,</hi> and, <hi>there was a time, when he was not,</hi> and the rest there mention'd, it seems irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and absurd, that they should be us'd or taught. To which wisely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd sentence we readily gave our suffrage, having never heretofore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custom'd our selves to such expressions. [Nor do we think it unfit to reject this, that, he was not before he was begotten, it being confess'd by all, that the Son of God was preexistent to his Incarnation: Yea, our most Religious Emperor has shewn, that as to his divine Generation, he was before all Worlds. For before he was in Act, he was potentially in the Father by a certain unbegotten way, the Father being always a Father, as always a King and a Saviour, being all things in respect of Power, always and as to all things the same.] These things, beloved, we thought necessary to acquaint you with, that you might know with how much caution we first stood off, and then yielded our assent, and how not without reason, we resisted till the last minute, so long as there was any thing otherwise written that might give offence; but afterwards quietly embrac'd what was inoffensive, after that, having candidly examin'd the meaning of what was said, it appear'd that they were consonant to that confession of Faith which we had first propos'd. We salute you, with the Brother-hood together with you, wishing you, honour'd Brethren, to farewell in the Lord.</p>

                     <p>Such was the Letter which <hi>Eusebius</hi> sent to his <hi>Caesareans,</hi> to let them know how affairs went in the Council, to prevent mis-reports concerning himself, and to assure them he had subscrib'd no other Doctrine, than what he had always delivered to them.

                        </gap> whereat they most boggled was of a more ancient date, us'd by the Fathers in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ages of the Church: And that when ever <hi>Eusebius</hi> speaks of Christ as in any sence created, he always means it of a divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, to wit, his eternal Generation; that he never denies him to be of the same substance with the Father in any other sence, than as the divine nature is incapable of division or separation after the manner of corporeal Beings. The Reader may farther remark, that that passage in the close of the Epistle concerning Christ's being <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and potentially in the Father,</hi> is confus'd and obscure, and indeed the whole Period, which we have included within Breaks, is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in this Epistle as 'tis in <hi>Socrates,</hi> nor in that translated by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient compiler of the <hi>Tripartite</hi> History. Whence one of these two things plainly follows, either that they left it out as a dangerous, and unaccountable passage, or (which to me seems more probable) that not being in the Original Copy of this Epistle, it was shuffled in by some other hand. For I cannot think <hi>Socrates</hi> would have been guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of so much both imprudence and unfaithfulness, as when he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to give the whole, to cut off, and conceal part of so conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable a Letter, and which being almost in every hand, must needs soon discover the Fraud.</p>

For which purpose there were Statues and Altars, and Sacrifices continually made upon them.

Which if any should dare to oppose, upon their Intimation to him, he should be punished according to the just Demerit of his Impiety and Folly. About this time I suppose it was (though I cannot certainly adjust the particular year) that <hi>Constantia, Constantine</hi>'s Sister, and relict of the late Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Licinius,</hi> wrote to <hi>Eusebius</hi> as Metropolitan of <hi>Palaestine,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring him to send her the Image or Picture of our Saviour.

                        <q>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause (sayes he) you desire me to send you the Image of Christ, tell me which, or what kind of Image of Christ it is you mean. Is it that real and unchangeable Form, that naturally bears the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of himself? Or that which he took upon him for our Sakes, when he cloathed himself with the Form of a Servant? As to the Form of God, I suppose you enquire not after it, being instructed by himself, that no man knows the Father but the Son, neither does any man sufficiently know the Son, but only the Father that begat him. You therefore unquestionably desire the Image of the Form of a Servant, that bodily shape which he undertook for us. But even this we know, to be taken into Partnership with the Glory of the Deity, and what was Mortal to be swallowed up of Life. What Painter then, with a few dead and inanimate Colours, a few Life-less lines and stroaks, could be able to take the resplendent lustre of so much Majesty and Glory; when the divine Disciples themselves were not able to look upon him in the Mount, but fell upon their Faces, confessing they were unable to bear such a sight? If therefore his bodily shape was so much altered, and deriv'd so much Power from the Divinity that dwelt in it; what may we say it is, now that he has put off Mortality, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wash'd from all shadow of Corruption, has exalted the shape of his servile Form, into the Glory of a Lord and God? as now it is, since his Victory over Death, his Ascention into Heaven, being seated upon a Throne of Majesty, at his Fathers right hand, and his resting in the unconceivable and ineffable Bosom of his Father, into which, while he was ascending to retake Possession, the holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels followed him with Hymns and Praises, saying, <hi>Lift up your Gates, O ye Princes, and be ye lift up ye everlasting Doors, and the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49523:72"/> King of glory shall come in.</hi>
                        </q> Such was his Answer to the Empresses Message. For which free and impartial Censure the Fathers of the second Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> the great Patrons of Image Worship, fall upon him with hard words, and Characters of reproach; as upon the same account <hi>Baronius</hi> and they of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> their Successors in that Doctrine and Practice, still do at this day.</p>

But <hi>Eusebius</hi> not caring to fish in troubled Waters, nor liking the See ever the better, out of which a Famous man had been so indirectly thrown, but especially behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it as against the Rules and Constitutions of the Church, which ordinarily allow'd not a Bishop to be translated from one See to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and this ratified by a Canon<note n="h" place="margin">Conc.

The Solemnity was manag'd with all imaginable Expressions of Festivity and Rejoycing, magnificent Feasts and Entertainments, mighty Charity to the Poor, but especially Acts of great Piety towards God, the Bishops imploying themselves in the Offices of Religion, in Prayers and Sermons, some celebrating the Emperor's Piety towards our Saviour, and the magnificence of the Structure; others discoursing upon some divine Subject, accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated to the present Occasion. Some expounding the Portion appointed to be read out of the holy Scriptures, explaining the mystical and hidden sence; others not so well qualified for that, being taken up in the Celebration of the Eucharist, and in Prayers and Praises, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceding with God for the common Peace, for the good of the Church, for the Emperor and his happy Issue. But herein none bore a greater Part than our <hi>Eusebius,</hi> honouring the Solemnity with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral publick Discourses, sometimes by writing, setting forth the greatness of the royal Edifice; other whiles representing the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick Scriptures, and adapting them to the present State of things; and after all, drawing up a particular Description of this famous Church, the fashion of our Saviour's Sepulchre, the beauty and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy of the Building, the several Gifts wrought with Gold, Silver, and precious Stones; in a Book on purpose of this Subject, which he dedicated to the Emperor, and annexed to his Books, <hi>De vita</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantini; but 'tis long since lost.</p>

And when fearing to tire him with the length of his Discourse, he offered in civility to break off, the Emperor bad him to proceed unto the End, at which he again press'd him to sit down, but the Emperor refus'd, saying, 'twas not fit at any time, much less at this, to hear Discourses concerning God in postures of ease and softness, and that it was very Pious to stand while we were hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Discourses about Divine things.

But being now at better leasure, they resum'd the Process, and finding the man would not comply with his former promise, they proceeded to his censure, and depos'd him from his Bishoprick, substituting one <hi>Basil</hi> a learned and eloquent Person in his room, and wrote to the Churches in those Parts to hunt out his Book, and burn it where-ever they found it, and to recover those who had been infected with it; annexing to their Epistle some Extracts out of it, containing those Pestilent <hi>Dogmata</hi> that were in it. Which done, they commanded<note n="a" place="margin">Euseb. loc. citat.</note> our <hi>Eusebius</hi> to undertake the Confutation of it, which he accordingly performed in five Books; the two first expresly written against <hi>Marcellus,</hi> wherein he exposes his Opinions out of his own Writings, with some brief Reflections upon them: In the other three intitled, <hi>de Ecclesiastica Theologia,</hi> dedicated to <hi>Flaccillus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> he sets himself to a more strict and accurate Refutation of them, and in both plainly evinces him to have been guilty of <hi>Sabellianism</hi> and the <hi>Samosatenian</hi> Errors. As for <hi>Marcellus</hi> himself he made a shift a long time to bear up his Reputation by his adhering to the Orthodox, sheltring himself

                        </note> that being haunted with the Conscience of his notorious Crimes in the Death of his Son <hi>Crispus,</hi> and his Lady <hi>Fausta,</hi> and his persidious dealing with <hi>Licinius,</hi> he applied himself to the <hi>Gentile</hi> Priests for Purgation and Absolution, who told him, their Religion allow'd no methods of Expiation for such great Offences; that hereupon he was brought into acquaintance with an <hi>Egyptian</hi> newly arriv'd from <hi>Spain,</hi> who assur'd him that the Christian Religion was able to do away any Crimes whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, and that no sooner did the most profligate Wretch close with it, but he should be immediately deliver'd from the Guilt of all his Sins; upon which assurance he renounc'd the Religion of his Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, and went over to the Christians. This is the Tale as told by my Author. But besides the known Spite and Malice of the man in Matters relating to Christianity, there needs no more to confute the Story, than that the account is inconsistent with it self, it being plain beyond all denial, that <hi>Constantine</hi> had embrac'd the Christian Religion no less than ten or eleven years before those unhappy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents of the Death of <hi>Crispus</hi> and <hi>Fausta</hi> fell out, which this Author makes the immediate occasion of his Conversion to it.

He was a man sober and serious, of a very strict and Philosophick course of Life, infinitely zealous for the Honour and Interest of the Christian Religion, which he readily defended against all Opposers. His Parts were great, and his Learning incomparable, for which the Age he liv'd in, and all Ages ever since have risen up before him with a just Veneration. So uncontroulable his Reputation herein, even in those early Times, that when <hi>Sabinus</hi> the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Bishop (who collected the Acts of several Synods) charg'd the Fathers of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, for a Company of rude and illiterate Persons, <hi>Socrates</hi>

Nay one of his greatest Adversaries<note n="t" place="margin">Antip. Bostr. l. <hi>1.</hi> adv. Euseb. Apol. pro Orig. in Synod. Nic. <hi>II.</hi> Act. <hi>V.</hi> Col. <hi>368.</hi> Concil. Tom.

He wrote sayes S. <hi>Jerom,</hi>

Nor was he less vers'd in the Antiquities of the Church, and the Acts and Sufferings of the Martyrs, the Memoires whereof he drew together, wherein he was furnish'd with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Advantage, if it be true, what S. <hi>Jerom,</hi> or the Author under his name probably enough reports,<note n="w" place="margin">Epist. ad Chrom. &amp; Heli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od. praef.

Nor, can it be denied, but that there are many unwary and dangerous Expressions to be found in his Writings: And what wonder, if one that had so long convers'd with the several Books and Principles of Philosophers, especially the Writings of the <hi>Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists,</hi> that had so throughly canvass'd the Books of <hi>Origen,</hi> should
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49523:78"/> express himself in such sublime and intricate Questions, in a way somewhat different from others of that Age, especially while as yet the Church had made no explicite Determination in those Points, considering withall, how loosely and uncautiously many other <hi>Ante-Nicene</hi> Fathers, as well as he, express themselves in these Matters? But not to rest in a general Apology, let us consider a little, what Materials he himself can furnish out to one that would undertake his Plea. And whoever impartially considers the Case, will find enough, I doubt not, in his own Writings, those especially of his latter time, to vindicate him from the Charge of downright <hi>Arianism,</hi> to be sure extreamly to mitigate the severity of the Censures that are pass'd upon him.

Nor did he subscribe rashly, and hand over head, but with mature deliberation, and after a most strict Examination of every word, and a being fully satisfied in the Sence of every Article, as in that Letter is declar'd at large.

                        </note> us our <hi>Eusebius</hi> expresly affirm'd in a Letter to <hi>Euphration,</hi> that Christ is not true God.

Sure I am, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, as 'tis represented by <hi>Athanasius,</hi> is plainly contrary to, and inconsistent with the most mature and deliberate Declarations of his mind in all his Writings extant at this day. All that can be guess'd at this distance is, what arises from the Acts of the second <hi>Nicene</hi> Council (where this<note n="a" place="margin">Act. <hi>VI.</hi> Conc.

And then for the other Expression, that the Son himself is God indeed, but not the true God, 'tis barely repeated; though we may rationally suppose, he directly referr'd in it to that saying of Christ, <hi>That they may know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.</hi> And him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self abundantly clears this matter, when he tells us,<note n="b" place="margin">Lib. <hi>1.</hi> adv.

                        </note> that <hi>Marcellus</hi> charg'd him with holding, not that there was only one God, but that there was only one true God; as if he allowed other Gods that were not truly and properly so. But he denies the Charge, that ever he affirm'd the Father to be the only true God, and appeals to his own words; and assures us, he had only quoted that foremention'd Text. And he complains<note n="c" place="margin">Ibid. p. <hi>29.</hi>
                        </note> of the same Person, that he accus'd him of holding Christ to be a meer man, for no other cause, than that in one of his Letters he had made use of that place of the Apostle; <hi>There is one God, and one Mediator between God and Man, the Man Christ Jesus.</hi>

In this Case, he tells us, the Church rather expounds the Opinion of its faithful Servants into a favourable sence, than nicely weighs and wracks their words; such a defence as it does not acquit the Innocent, so neither does it make the other Guilty. Amongst the Writers of this latter Age, none have fallen upon him with greater severity than <hi>Baronius,</hi> who when he has so often plentifully treated his Readers at his cost, falls upon him with the fierceness of an Enemy, hooking in all Occasions to bespatter and reproach him, whether with greater rudeness or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, 'tis hard to say. And the Case had been the more pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, had it been pure Zeal for the Truth, that had engag'd him in those smart Invectives. But I'm afraid 'twas something else made him so irreconcileably angry with <hi>Eusebius,</hi> I mean his affirming <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> the Great to have been baptiz'd at <hi>Nicomedia</hi> a little before his Death, thereby robbing the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> of the Honour of it, and what's worse, of those great Gifts and extraordinary Priviledges and Immunities said by him to have been, at the time of his Baptism, confer'd upon that Church. 'Twas this<note n="h" place="margin">Vid. Baron. ad Ann. <hi>324.</hi> Num. <hi>XLIII. &amp;</hi> Seqq.</note> so much provok'd the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49523:80"/> Cardinals choler, for this he pelts him with hard Names, calls him <hi>Arian,</hi> Cheat, and Impostor, affirming, that he feign'd this in favor of <hi>Constantius</hi> the <hi>Arian</hi> Emperor. But let us see what Foundation there is for all this Out-cry. <hi>Eusebius</hi> liv'd at that time, no man of his Order greater at Court, and was near enough to know the Truth of what was done nay probably was himself upon the spot amongst those Bishops he speaks of, that were call'd to Court, and thereby enabled to give so ready an account of the Discourses, and all the particular Circumstances of that dying Emperor. And suppose him to have had a design to forge such a Report, it was not consistent with a man of ordinary either Piety or Prudence to have publish'd it when the thing was fresh, and so many Persons of Quality and Credit capable to disprove him. Besides he has all Antiquity herein on his side; not to mention particular Writers, the Catholick Bishops met in the Synod at <hi>Ariminum</hi> not much above twenty years after, attest the same thing in their Letter<note n="i" place="margin">Ap.

And yet after all, the whole Story is built upon no better Foundation than the fabulous Acts of S. <hi>Silvester,</hi> which have no just Ground or Pillar of Truth or Probability to support them.

Nor was it the least Addition to its Honour, that amongst many other Fathers of the Church, illustrious for Learning and Piety, it gave Birth to <hi>Athanasius,</hi> a Person so renown'd in the Histories of the Church.

Hitherto <hi>Alexander</hi> was well enough contented with the Childrens sport, but when he saw them take upon them to administer what he thought resembled the sacred and solemn Rites of the Church, and the most hidden and concealed My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of Religion, he sent some of the Clergy (who by this time were come) to enquire into the meaning of the Action. The Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren affrighted at first, began to deny what they had done, affirming that there was no more in it than common Sport, but being severely press'd, confess'd the Mystery of the whole childish Scene, that <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius</hi> had sustain'd the place of a Bishop, and had baptiz'd some Children whom they presented to him, who had not been baptiz'd before. This put him upon enquiring farther into the Manner and Circumstances of that Affair, and whether it had been manag'd by the usual way of Interrogations and Answers, and finding that every thing had been exactly done according to the Custom and Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Church, upon advice with his Clergy it was concluded, that the Children so initiated should not be re-baptiz'd, but only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summated by Confirmation. And having sent for <hi>Athanasius</hi> his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and those of the rest, who had wantonly usurp'd the Place of the Clergy, he deliver'd them to them with a solemn Charge to give them such Education, as might fit them for the Ministry of the Church, and the discharge of that Office, which in sport they had taken upon them. <hi>Athanasius</hi> hereupon was consign'd to Masters and Tutors, and being sufficiently perfected in humane Arts and Studies, his Parents return'd him to the Bishop, who took him into his Family, us'd him as his Secretary and <hi>Amanuensis</hi> to read to him, and write for him; and when maturity of Age had qualified him for it, ordain'd him Deacon; and finding his Parts brisk and pregnant, and his Zeal vigorous and sincere, took<note n="c" place="margin">Vid.

For the clearer understanding of which Affair, it being the great Transaction of his whole Life, we must step back a while, that we may derive the notices of things from the Fountain-head.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. <hi>PETER</hi> Bishop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> succeeded <hi>Theonas</hi> in that See, <hi>Ann. Chr.</hi> CCC. or at most but the year before. And scarce had he sitten three years quietly in the Chair, when the <hi>Diocletian</hi> Persecution overtook the Church, wherein he with many more of Note and Quality were apprehended and cast into Prison, in which number was <hi>Meletius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Lycus</hi> in <hi>Thebais,</hi> a Person, next <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> of greatest Authority and Power, and under him Director gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of all the Affairs of the Church. The severity of the Persecution (so <hi>Epiphanius</hi>

                        </note> relates the Story, though no where more confus'd and careless than in the <hi>Meletian</hi> and <hi>Arian</hi> Relations, and in this case reporting things not very consistently with other Writers of those Times,) tempted many of all Orders of men, to renounce the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49523:83"/> Faith▪ and comply with the <hi>Gentile</hi> Rites, who repenting afterwards of what they had done, apply'd themselves to the Martyrs and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors in Prison for Absolution, that they might be restor'd to Peace and Communion with the Church. This, <hi>Meletius</hi> and others would by no means yield to, affirming it would set open the door to Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy from the Christian Faith, if when men had laps'd into Idolatry, they might at their return find so ready entertainment. <hi>Peter</hi> acted with the resentments and compassion of a common Father, was for the more mild and moderate Opinion, that a time of Pennance being assign'd, they might be re-admitted into the Church, lest Affliction be added to the afflicted, and men being put upon a desperate Issue, might be tempted to a total and final Apostacy from Christianity. But not being able to prevail either by Arguments or Intreaties, he hung up his Mantle cross the Prison, crying out, they that are of my side, let them come hither; they that are for <hi>Meletius,</hi> let them go to him. Whereupon a few Bishops and others came over to him, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est part remaining with <hi>Meletius.</hi> Which widened the difference into such a Breach, that ever after they parted Companies, and in all Acts of divine Worship, kept their separate Assemblies. But it was not long before <hi>Meletius</hi> himself stood in need of that Mercy, which he had so rigidly denied to others, being through the infirmity of his Faith, betray'd to offer Sacrifice to Idols. Which though not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd by <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> (who doubtless transcrib'd his Reports out of the Acts of the <hi>Meletians,</hi> which may justly be presum'd partial in their own Cause) is yet by a much better Author, I mean <hi>Athanasius</hi>

The Issue was, <hi>Peter</hi> receiv'd the Crown of Martyrdom, <hi>Meletius</hi> being got out of Prison, still bore up himself with the Power and Reputation of a Bishop, ordaining Bishops, Presbyters and Deacons whereever he came, erecting Churches for his own Party, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing to communicate with the other; each Party distinguishing their Assemblies by an Inscription over their Church doors; those who belong'd to <hi>Peter,</hi> and possess'd the Churches of the old Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, entitling themselves, <hi>the Catholick Church;</hi> those of <hi>Mele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, the Church of the Martyrs.</hi> This Schism commenc'd <hi>Ann.</hi> CCCVI. <hi>Meletius</hi> vomiting up nothing but railings and reproaches against <hi>Peter</hi> and his Successors, complaining how much he had been injur'd by them.

Great and powerful Intercession would be made for him to that end, but he should not do it, but should give the like charge to <hi>Achillas</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> his Presbyters, who were to be his Successors. The next day<note n="h" place="margin">
                           <hi>Ib. p.</hi> 193. &amp;c.</note> came a great crowd of Presbyters and Deacons to the Prison (whom <hi>Arius</hi> had engag'd to speak for him,) earnestly importuning the Bishop for his Absolution. No sooner had they mention'd his name, but he interrupted them; <hi>Arius</hi> (said he) <hi>shall be separated from the glory of God, both in this World, and in that which is to come, even as he himself separated the Son of God from the Glory and Co-essentiality of the Father.</hi> (Though he did not actually do this till afterwards.) And taking <hi>Achillas</hi> and <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> aside, he acquainted them with his Vision, and imparted to them the same Charge that had been delivered to him. <hi>Peter</hi> being consummated by Martyrdom, <hi>Achillas</hi> one of the Presbyters of that Church succeeded him; a man Grave and Pious, but of a more calm and easie Disposition than his Predecessor. An advantage which <hi>Arius</hi> knew how to improve, and accordingly upon the Profession of his Repentance was restor'd, yea and advanc'd to the Order of a Presbyter, one of the Churches of <hi>Alexandria</hi> call'd <hi>Baucalis,</hi> being assign'd to him for his Cure; for it was the<note n="i" place="margin">Epiph. contr.

And then for his own Principles which he asserted, he declares, that the Son is not unbegotten, nor any wayes any part of the unbegotten, that by Council and Decree he did before all Times and Ages subsist perfect God, the only begotten, and immutable; and that before he was begotten, or created, or determin'd, or found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he was not; that the Son had a beginning, but that God was without all beginning; and that he therefore affirm'd him to proceed out of a State of Non-existence, as being no part of God, nor of any subject Matter: That<note n="d" place="margin">Excerpt. ex Arii Thalia ap.

And for this attempt he was not a little prepar'd by the Principles which he had suckt in from <hi>Lucian</hi> of <hi>Antioch</hi> (though whether at the first or second hand it is hard to say) concerning the Person of our blessed Saviour, whom he maintain'd to be no more than a meer man, which <hi>Lucian</hi> himself had deriv'd from <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Samosata.</hi> For that <hi>Arius</hi> was one of that Tribe, we shall see by and by.</p>

And though by reason of their clancular Actings he had somewhat late discovered them, yet had he Synodically condemned, and cast them out of the Catholick Church; but so far were they from acquiescing in that Sentence, that they dispers'd themselves abroad, and by Flattery and Dissimulation had so far impos'd upon foreign Bishops, as to procure large Letters of Commendation from them, which they made use of to great Advantage; nay, by some they had been admitted to Communion, whose rashness herein was to be blamed. Next, he exposes the Impiety of their Principles, concerning the divine Nature, and eternal existence of the Son of God; and shews at what places of Scripture they took Sanctuary to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; all which he refutes at large with admirable clearness and dexterity, and withall states the Catholick Doctrine in this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Then he proceeds to enquire into the Original of these mens Principles, which he shews to have been first brooded and hatcht by <hi>Ebion</hi> and <hi>Artemas,</hi> afterwards nourished by <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Samosata,</hi> then by <hi>Lucian</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> the very dregs of whose Opinion had been drank in, and vomited up by <hi>Arius, Achillas,</hi> and the rest; wherein they had received but too much encouragement from the three <hi>Syrian</hi> Bishops (he means <hi>Eusebius</hi> of <hi>Caesarea, Paulinus</hi> of <hi>Tyre,</hi> and <hi>Theodotus</hi> of <hi>Laodicea</hi>) whose Case he wish'd might be canvass'd and examin'd. That for himself, it was no wonder if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter so many bold Reflections upon the Son of God, and the devest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him of his Divinity, they should liberally bestow their Scorn, their Slanders and Calumnies upon him and his Party, and decry them as a Company of ignorant and illiterate Fellows, boasting that all Wisdom dwelt with them, and that they had discovered Truths that had been hidden from Ages and Generations, and which had never so much as entred into the thoughts of any but of themselves alone. This he cryes out upon as a most impious Arrogance, and an unmensurable madness, a piece of Pride kindled by the Devil, which neither the divine Demonstration of Scripture, nor the una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous Consent of Bishops in the Doctrine of Christ, was able to restrain; nay, that herein they out-did the Impiety of the Devil, who durst not utter one word to blaspheme the Son of God. Hence he goes on to declare his belief in all the great Articles of the Creed, both concerning God the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghost; the one Catholick and Apostolick Church, the Resurrection of the Dead, founded in that of our Lord <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> who truly, and not in appearance, took our Flesh upon him, and was born of <hi>Mary the Mother of God</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:49523:87"/> World came hither for the Expiation of sin, who was crucified, and died (though without any impairing, or disparagement to his Godhead) rose again from the Dead, was taken up into Heaven, and set down at the right Hand of the divine Majesty. This was the Doctrine he taught and preach'd, this the Apostolick Faith of the Church, for which he was ready to lay down his Life, little regarding the Opposition that was made against it by <hi>Arius</hi> and his Accomplices, Enemies of the Truth, who were therefore expell'd the Church, according to S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s sentence in the Case, that <hi>if any one,</hi> yea though pretending himself, <hi>an Angel from Heaven should preach any other Gospel than what they had receiv'd, he should be accursed.</hi> In Conclusion he advises him, that he would keep a vigilant Eye upon them, who under a pretence of Peace and Piety, labour'd to insinuate themselves in all Parts, that he would give them no entertainment, who had been regularly expell'd and cast out of the Church, but by Letters would testifie his agreement in the Apostolick Doctrine, and his Approbation of what he had acted against those Gain-sayers, as great numbers had done in all Provinces, as he might see by the account which by <hi>Appion</hi> his Deacon he then sent to him.</q> This is the sum of that very prolix Letter, which though particularly directed to the Bishop of <hi>Byzan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium,</hi> yet (as is plain from several Passages in it) was intended to be of a more general Concernment, and that Copies of it (as no doubt they were) should be communicated to all the neighbour Bishops. To the same Effect he wrote<note n="p" place="margin">Theod. ib. p. <hi>20</hi> Epiph. ubi supr. Socr. l. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>6.</hi> p. <hi>15.</hi>

Epistles, which together with their Answers, were carefully collected and kept together; as were also those of <hi>Arius</hi> and his side, and laid up in the several Repositories of each Party, whence the Writers of those times furnish'd themselves with Materials for the Transactions of that Age.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. AMONGST those to whom <hi>Arius</hi> address'd himself, the chief was <hi>Eusebius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> the Head and Champion of the Cause. He had sometime been Bishop of <hi>Berytus</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> and thence translated to <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> which being at that time the Seat of the <hi>Eastern</hi> Emperors, gave him a fair Opportunity to ingratiate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with the great Ministers of State, and to render himself consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for Power and Interest at Court. He was a man of Parts and Learning, of a subtle and a daring Temper, but of a Head deeply infected with those Principles, which <hi>Arius</hi> had newly broach'd to the World. For which we are to know, that <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Samosata</hi> Bishop of <hi>Antioch</hi> in the declining Part of the foregoing Age, had been by a Synod depos'd for some heretical Doctrines, concerning the Trinity, and the Person of the Son of God. These Principles with some Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements and Alterations, <hi>Lucian,</hi> who was born at the same Town of <hi>Samosata,</hi> and about the same time Presbyter also of the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> took up, and so stiffly maintain'd, that for many years, during the intire presidency<note n="q" place="margin">Alex. Epist. ap. Theod. ubi supr. p. <hi>15.</hi>
                        </note> of the three succeeding Bishops, he withdrew himself from the Communion of the Church; though towards the end of his Life, he probably retracted his Errors, and suffered Martyrdom under the late Persecution. Disciples he had many, whom he had train'd up in his erroneous Opinion, who

But the good Bishop stood firm and immovable as a Rock, deaf to all such Importunities. Which <hi>Arius</hi> perceiving, sent Agents to the Bishops of <hi>Palaestine,</hi> desiring that by their Sentence he might be allow'd to assemble his Congregation, as aforetime he had done. The Bishops being met, assented to his Petition, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, charg'd him and his Fellows to behave themselves with all due Reverence and Submission to their own Bishop.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. ELATED with the Letters and Interposals of so many and such potent Intercessors; <hi>Arius</hi> behav'd himself with greater Arrogance than before. He boasted of his great Alliances, and the numbers of those that consented with him, shewed the Letters that had been written to him, and in his behalf, proceeded confidently in his seditious Meetings, and despis'd his Adversaries as simple and illiterate. To repress whose Insolence, <hi>Alexander</hi> found it necessary to convene a second Synod at <hi>Alexandria;</hi> for that it was distinct from the former, seems evident from the number of the Persons sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenc'd, ten only being condemn'd in the first, fourteen in this latter Synod, two of which, <hi>viz.

Accordingly <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>

                           <p>TO our dear and venerable Brethren, our Colleagues in the Ministry of the Catholick Church wheresoever dispers'd, <hi>Alexander</hi> in the Lord greeting. For as much as the Body of the Catholick Church is but one, and that we are commanded in the holy Scriptures to keep the bond of Peace and Concord, it is very fit that we should write to you, and that whatever passes amongst us, should be mutually communicated to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, so that whether one Member suffer, we also may suffer with it; or one Member rejoyce, we may rejoyce with it. Know therefore that within our Diocess, certain bad men, Enemies to Christ are risen up, who propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate an Apostacy; which a man may very truly judge and style the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of <hi>Anti-christ.</hi> Desirous I was to have stiffled and conceal'd this Matter, that the Venom might have been kept only within these Apostates, and so have expir'd, and not spread it self abroad into other Parts, and infect the Minds of the Simple. But since <hi>Eusebius</hi> now Bishop of <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>media</hi> (who presumes that the disposal of all Ecclesiastick Affairs is lodged with him, especially since having deserted <hi>Berytus,</hi> he has possess'd himself of the See of <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> without being prosecuted for it as a Violator of the Canons; since he) hath undertaken the Patronage of these Apostates, and has written Letters in their Commendation into all Parts, to seduce unwary and undiscerning Persons to this execrable and <hi>Anti-christian</hi> Heresie; I thought it necessary, considering what is written in the Law, to be no longer silent, but to acquaint you all with the State of things, that you may both know the Apostates themselves, and understand the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Terms and Expressions of this Heresie, and that if <hi>Eusebius</hi> have written to any of you, you may give no heed to it. By these Persons he endeavours to broach and bring to light that corrupt and perverse Mind, which he has a long time conceal'd, and though he pretends he only writes in their behalf, yet he sufficiently declares he does it upon his own account. The Names of those who have thus apostatiz'd, are these, <hi>Arius, Achillas, Aithales, Carpones,</hi> another <hi>Arius, Sarmates, Euzoius, Lucius, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianus, Menas, Helladius, Gaius;</hi> and together with them, <hi>Secundus</hi> and <hi>Theonas,</hi> heretofore accounted Bishops. The Doctrines which they have started without any ground from Scripture, and which they publickly vent, are these. God (say they) was not alwayes a Father, but there was a time, when he was God, but not Father: The word of God was not alwayes, but sprang out of nothing. For he that was God, made him that was not, out of that which was not; and therefore there was a time, when
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49523:88"/> he was not. For the Son is a Creature, and the Workmanship of God; neither in Essence like to the Father, nor the true and natural Word, or Wisdom of the Father, but one of the Creatures that were made, and is only improperly styl'd the Word and Wisdom: For as much as he himself was made by the genuine word of God, and by that Wisdom that is in God, by which God made him as well as all other things. Ʋpon this account he is in his own nature mutable and alterable, as all rational Creatures are. He is a word Foreign, and separated from the Essence of God. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is incomprehensible and ineffable to the Son; who neither perfectly and accurately knows him, nor is able perfectly to behold him. Nay the Son understands not his own Substance, of what kind it is. For he was made for our Sakes, that by him as by an Instrument God might create us: Nor had he ever had any Being, had not God design'd to create us. And when they were askt, whether the Word of God might change, as the Devil did, they blush'd not to reply, he might do so; for being made and created, he must be of a mutable Nature. While therefore <hi>Arius</hi> and his Party dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd at this rate, and impudently preach'd these things up and down, we with the Bishops of <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Libya,</hi> to the number of near an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, met in a Synod, where we anathematiz'd them, and all that adher'd to them. Notwithstanding which, <hi>Eusebius</hi> and his Followers gave them entertainment, endeavouring to blend Falshood with Truth, and to confound Impiety and Religion. But they shall be able to do nothing. For Truth is Mighty, and will overcome; neither <hi>is there any Communion of light with darkness, or any Concord of Christ with</hi> B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Or who is there that hears them now, and does not stand amaz'd, and stop his ears, that they may not be defil'd with such wretched and infections Discourses? Who can hear S. <hi>John</hi> say, <hi>In the beginning was the Word,</hi> and not presently condemn those that assert, that there was a time when he was not? Or who can hear those Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions in the Gospel, <hi>the only begotten Son;</hi> and, <hi>by him all things were made,</hi> but he must abominate those that affirm, that the Son is one of the Creatures? For how can he be one of those things which himself made? Or how can he be the only begotten, who according to them is levell'd with the rank of all created Beings? How can he arise out of nothing, when the Father assures us,<note n="a" place="margin">Psalm XLIV. <hi>1.</hi> juxta Septu.</note>
                              <hi>my heart hath sent forth a good Word;</hi> and elsewhere,<note n="b" place="margin">Psalm CIX. <hi>4.</hi> Septuag.</note>
                              <hi>from the Womb before the day-spring have I begotten thee?</hi> Or how is he in Substance unlike the Father, when he is <hi>the perfect Image and brightness of his Father,</hi> and has himself told us, <hi>he that hath seen me, hath seen the Father?</hi> How can the Son be the Word and Wisdom of God, if there was a time, when he was not? For 'tis as if they should say, there was a time, when God was without Wisdom and Reason. How can he be liable to Change and Alteration, when he tells us of himself, <hi>I am in the Father, and the Father in me?</hi> And, <hi>I and the Father am one;</hi> and by the Prophet, <hi>behold, I am, and I change not.</hi> And though some may refer this Expression to the Father, yet may it now be more conveniently understood of the Son; for that being become man, he is not changed, but as the Apostle sayes, <hi>Jesus Christ, the same to day, yesterday, and for ever.</hi> But what was it induc'd them to affirm, that he was made for us; when S. <hi>Paul</hi> testifies, <hi>for whom, and by whom are all things?</hi> As for their blasphemous asserting, that the Son does not perfectly know the Father, no man ought to wonder at it. For having once pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd War against Christ, they easily set at nought his words, that tell us, <hi>as
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:49523:89"/> the Father knows me, so know I the Father.</hi> If therefore the Father knows the Son in part, plain it is, that the Son also in part knows the Father. But if it be unlawful to affirm that, and if the Father per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly knows the Son, 'tis most evident, that in the same manner that the Father knows his Word, in the same does the Word know his Father, whose Word he is. With these Arguments, and the frequent urging of the holy Scriptures, we have often convinc'd and silenced them. But they <hi>Chame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion</hi>-like, presently again chang'd colour, making good in themselves, that which is written; that when the wicked is come to the bottom of evil, he will still despise. Many Heresies have arisen before these, which attempting more than was meet, have fallen into folly and madness. But these men, by their attempts to destroy the Divinity of the Word, which is the scope and design of all their Discourses, have justified all those ancient Heresies, and do themselves much nearer approach to <hi>Anti-christ.</hi> For which cause they are anathematiz'd, and cut off from the Church. We are indeed heartily griev'd for the Destruction of these men, and especially for that having h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>retofore receiv'd the Doctrine and Communion of the Church, they are now departed from it. Which yet we ought not to think strange. For thus did <hi>Hymenaeus</hi> and <hi>Philetus,</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> before them both, who having been a Disciple of our Saviour, became afterwards a Traytor and an Apostate. Nor have we been left without warning of these things. For our Lord foretold, <hi>Beware, lest any man seduce you. For many shall come in my name, saying, I am he, and the time is at hand, and shall deceive many: but go not after them.</hi> And <hi>Paul,</hi> who learnt these things from our Saviour, writes thus: <hi>In the latter times some shall depart from the Faith, giving heed to seducing Spirits, and Doctrines of Devils, that turn away men from the Truth.</hi> Since therefore our Lord and Saviour <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> has both himself forewarn'd, and by his Apostle given us notice of these Matters, we who were Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witnesses of these mens Impiety, have justly condemn'd them, and declar'd them separte from the Catholick Church and Faith. This, dear and hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oured Brethren, we have thought good to signifie to your Piety, that you may neither entertain any of them, if they shall have the Confidence to come to you, nor give any credit to <hi>Eusebius</hi> or any man else that shall write in their behalf. For it becomes us, as we are Christians, to turn away from all those that either opine, or speak against Christ, as Enemies to God, and Corrupters of mens Souls, and not so much <hi>as bid them God speed, lest we be partakers of their evil Deeds,</hi> as S. <hi>John</hi> has charg'd us. Salute the Brethren that are with you. They that are with me salute you.</p>

However the Effect was, that men generally became more shy of his acquaintance and Company. Whereupon finding his entertainment grow colder in these Parts, he betook himself to his great Patron at <hi>Nicomedia;</hi> with whom he found a hearty Welcome, being receiv'd with all the Demonstrations of Affection and Friendship. While he continued here, he again attempted to reconcile himself to his own Bishop, by explaining his Principles, and avoiding what he thought might be charg'd upon them, though he rendred them not one Syllable better than he had done before, which he did in a Letter<note n="c" place="margin">Ext. ap.

Nor could the Pope derive his Proxy upon a fitter Person, a man of great Name and Note, already conversant in those Parts, and that had been concern'd and busied in those Affairs. But the best of it is, there was no such thing, not is there any ground in Story for asserting it. And accordingly we find men of Learning,<note n="k" place="margin">Fr. Bivar. Comment. in L. Dextr.

One of which priding himself in the neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and elegancy of his Discourses, reflected with scorn upon the Fathers of the Council. A piece of insolence so intolerable, that an ancient Confessor then in the Company, a man plain, and unskill d in the Tricks and Methods of disputing, not being able to bear it, offered himself to undertake him. For which he was laugh'd at by some, while others more modest and serious, fear'd what would be the success of his entring the Lists with so able and fam'd a Disputant. The good man however went on with his Resolution, and bluntly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>costed his Adversary in this manner. <q>In the name of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> Philosopher, give ear. There is one God, maker of Heaven and Earth, and of all things visible and invisible, who created all these things by the Power of his Word, and ratifies them by the Sanctity of his holy Spirit. This word which we call the Son of God, pitty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Apostacy and brutish State of Mankind, condescended to be born of a Woman, to dwell amongst men, and to dye for them, who shall come again to sit as Judge upon whatever we do in this Life. These things we plainly believe. Strive not therefore to no purpose, to endeavour the Confutation of what we entertain by Faith, or to find out how these things may, or may not be; but answer me, if thou dost believe.</q> The Philosopher astonish'd and thunder-struck with the Zeal and plainness of the old man's Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, answered that he did believe; and thanking that Conqueror that had overcome him, yielded up himself to his Sentiments and Opinions, perswading his Companions to do the like, solemnly
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:49523:92"/> affirming, that it was by an unspeakable Power, and not without immediate Direction from Heaven, that he was thus brought over to be a Christian. This passage, for substance the same both in <hi>Rufinus, Socrates</hi> and <hi>Sozomen, Gelasius Cyzicenus,</hi> has improv'd into many ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate Stories, having given us at large the particular Disputations of these Philosophers, with the Replies of the several Fathers of the Synod about the <hi>Arian</hi> Doctrines; which being in all likelyhood no better than the Issue of his own brain, we here omit.</p>

This freedom of debate soon multiplied infinite Questions, and produc'd various and different Counsels and Perswasions about the Matter. Some advis'd that no Innovations should be made in Matters of Faith, but that it should be still entertain'd with the same naked Simplicity, wherewith from the beginning it had been delivered to the Church; men of simple and honest Minds not thinking it fit that Articles concerning God should be made the Subject of subtle and over-curious Disputes. Others contending that Times and Circumstances altered the decency of things, and that we ought not implicitly to follow the Opinions of the Ancients, without due trial and Examination. These Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations were manag'd with great heat and briskness, both by them of the Episcopal, and by others of inferior Orders, amongst which, in the former capacity none appear'd with more warmth and zeal than <hi>Alexander,</hi> as being most immediately concern'd in the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie, as amongst the latter none behav'd himself with more smart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and accuracy than <hi>Athanasius,</hi> at that time Deacon of the Church of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> whom <hi>Alexander</hi> had brought along with him to the Synod, where with all boldness and vehemency he assaulted and oppos'd the <hi>Arian</hi> Principles, for which (as the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Bishops in their Synodical Epistle tells<note n="k" place="margin">Ap.

HITHERTO the Fathers had been exercis'd only with private and preparatory Disquisitions, like light Skirmishes to the main Battel: But now they were to act more solemnly in a Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical way to bring the thing to a final Issue; at which Assembly, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, none were present of the inferior Clergy, at least none gave their Votes.

                        </note> in the Palace, where all things were made ready to receive them, the Emperor came attended not with his usual Guards, but Persons eminent for their Faith and Piety. He entred the Council with all imaginable Pomp and State, cloath'd with the richest and most splendid Robes, but with a mind humble and pious in the midst of all his greatness. He pass'd through the Ranks on each side, to the upper end of the Hall, where he plac'd himself in the midst, and having receiv'd an Intimation from the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops that all things were ready, sat down in the Chair that was plac'd for him, after which the Fathers took their Places, and some
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:49523:93"/> of them having a while entertain'd him with Speeches in the name of the Synod, silence was made, and in the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue (which by the Interpreter was soon rendred into <hi>Greek</hi>) he discours'd to them to this Effect. <q>That there was nothing which he had more passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately desir'd, then to behold this venerable Assembly, for which being now met, he return'd hearty thanks to the supream Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the World; that he desir'd no envious man might here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after interrupt their Prosperity, and that when the divine Power of our Saviour had delivered them from the Oppositions of impious and atheistical Tyrants, the mischievous Enemy of Mankind might not be suffered to shift the Scene, and attempt it by another way: That he look'd upon the intestine Divisions of the Church of God, as the most pernicious and dangerous Commotions, nothing creating so great a trouble to his mind: That when God had blessed him with such happy success against his Enemies, he had well hop'd he had had nothing to do, but to celebrate the divine Goodness, and rejoyce in the common Safety; but being unexpectedly arrested with the unwelcome News of their Dissentions, he thought himself oblig'd immediately to take care about it, and had for that end so suddenly call'd them together, as the most proper and effectual Remedy in this Matter, and should then think he had done it to good purpose, when he should see them joyn hearts and hands to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and promote the publick Peace and Concord, which as Persons consecrated to God, they were above all others bound to procure and further; That therefore, as Ministers of God, as faithful Servants of the common Lord and Saviour, they should endeavour, that all occasions of Difference being thrown out of the way, and the noise of Contention being dissolv'd, they might preserve things in the bond of Peace. By which means (said he) you will at once do what is highly acceptable to the great God, and infinitely gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie me your Fellow-Servant.</q> And certainly it was not without reason, that this pious Prince so pathetically press'd them to Peace and Unity. For amongst other Artifices to obstruct the Proceedings of the Council, this was not the least, to exasperate the minds of the Bishops against each other, by which means they had charg'd and impeach'd<note n="m" place="margin">Sozom. l. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>17.</hi> p. <hi>430.</hi> Theod. l. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>11.</hi> p. <hi>36.</hi>

And having af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards made Peace amongst them, produced the Bundle, and grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chiding them for their mutual Recriminations, told them; <q>That these things were reserv'd for the Decisions of the great day, and were not so proper for the Cognizance of humane Judicatures, both Plaintiff and Defendant being Persons in holy Offices, who ought to do nothing that may make them liable to those Tribunals: That setting before them the divine Clemency and Indulgence, they should forbear and forgive one another; and laying aside their Quarrels, agree, and mind the things that concern'd the Faith, the end for which they were there met together.</q> And with that he threw the Papers into the Fire, seriously protesting, that he had not read one word of them; that it was not fit the Faults of Priests should be publish'd to the Scandal of the People, who might thence derive a Warrant to themselves to sin with more freedom and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:49523:93"/> that for his own part, if he should chance to espy a Bishop overtaken in a wanton and immodest Action, he would cover him with his own imperial Cloak, rather than it should be expos'd to the offence and scandal of Spectators. But to proceed.</p>

The Case at first was argued with heat on both sides, with great Contention and Opposition, there being Seventeen of the Bishops that appear'd in favour of the <hi>Arian</hi> Cause, and some few more it may be, that did not openly declare themselves. In these Contests the good Emperor sat<note n="p" place="margin">Eus. de vit. Const. l. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>13.</hi> p. <hi>490.</hi>
                        </note> as a publick Moderator, hearing the Debates with an unwearied Patience, and weighing the Arguments with an intent and judicious Mind: To what appear'd just and reasonable, he gave a ready Assent; where any were Refractory and Pertinacious, he sought to reclaim them by mild and gentle Means; some he conquered by Reason and Argument; others he prevail'd with by Importunity and Perswasion; endeavouring to reduce all to Love and Peace.

                        </note> will have this Libel brought in not by the <hi>Nicomedian,</hi> but <hi>Caesarean Eusebius;</hi> and that it was that <hi>Formula</hi> or Confession of Faith, which <hi>Eusebius</hi> brought into the Synod, and of which himself has given us a particular account in his Letter<note n="t" place="margin">Ap.

Most probable therefore it is, that the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comedian</hi> Confession being rejected by the Synod, another was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented by <hi>Eusebius</hi> of <hi>Caesarea,</hi> as a more sound and safe Expedient.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. BUT though this of <hi>Eusebius</hi> was consonant and agreeable enough to the Doctrine of the Church, yet was it not thought suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently punctual and expressive in the Minutes and Criticisms of the Controversie.

                        </note> and were so subtle and deceitful in their Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that the Fathers thought they could never particularly enough provide against them. When the Orthodox asserted Christ to be God, the <hi>Arians</hi> allowed it, but then meant it in no other Sence, than as Angels and Holy men are styl'd Gods, and the Sons of God in Scripture: When they affirm'd him to be true God, the others assented, that he was truly made so by God; if the Catholicks main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd that the Son was naturally of God, the <hi>Arians</hi> would grant it;
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49523:94"/> for even we (say they) are of God, <hi>there being one God, of whom are all things.</hi> Did the one hold, that the Son was the Power, Wisdom, and Image of the Father; the other never scrupled to admit it, for that we also are said to be <hi>the Image and Glory of God,</hi> and even the meanest Creatures are sometimes call'd the great Power of God. Such being the Crafty and Fraudulent shifting of their Adversaries, the Fathers found themselves oblig'd to collect together the places of Scripture which represent the Divinity of the Son of God, which they more particularly declar'd to be meant of his being of the same Substance with the Father, that Creatures were said to be of God, because not existing of themselves, they had their Rise and Beginning from him; but the Son only was properly of the Substance of the Father; this being the peculiar propriety of the only begotten, and the true Word of the Father. All which they sum'd up into this one word <gap reason="foreign">

Him they confine to his own City, allow him the title of a Bishop, but without any Episcopal Power or Jurisdiction either in City or Country. The Persons that had been ordain'd by him, being first confirm'd by <hi>Alexander,</hi> their proper Metropolitan, were to be admitted to Communion, and to the exercise of their several Ministries; but according to the Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of their Station, were to take place after all other Clergy-men, in all Churches and Parishes where they come, and as others died out of any place, they in their Order might succeed, being regularly chosen by the People, and the Election ratified by the Bishop of <hi>Alexandria:</hi> But that they themselves should have no hand in the Election, or Power to choose whom they would.

THE next thing that came under debate (for being thus far engag'd, we shall give a brief account of the whole Transactions of the Synod) was the Paschal Controversie, concerning the time of the Celebration of <hi>Easter,</hi> wherein the Christian World was so much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided; the <hi>Asiaticks</hi> and <hi>Eastern</hi> Churches observing it after the <hi>Jewish</hi> Custom, on the fourteenth day after the <hi>Phasis</hi> or appearance of the Moon, the rest on the next Lord's day after the <hi>Jewish</hi> Passo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. A Question controverted from the very Infancy of the Church, and manag'd even by good men with great Bitterness and Animosity, and about this time reviv'd as hot as ever. The suppressing whereof was one of the Emperor's prime inducements<note n="i" place="margin">Eus. de vit. Const. l. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>5, 14, 18, 19.</hi>

And thus was this storm on a sudden calm'd, which the endeavours of preceding Ages were never able to allay.

But why then (said <hi>Constantine</hi>) do you separate from the Communion of the Church?

The Emperor paus'd a little, and considering the unmerciful strictness of this Rule, replied, <hi>if so, then</hi> Acesius, <hi>set up your Ladder, and go to Heaven by your self.</hi> This Story is question'd by the late Publisher<note n="o" place="margin">Val.

                           <head>To the holy and great Church by the grace of God setled at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and to the dear Brethren through <hi>Egypt, Libya,</hi> and <hi>Pentapolis,</hi> the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops assembled at <hi>Nice,</hi> and there constituting a great and holy Synod, in our Lord greeting.</head>
                           <p>SINCE by the favour of God, and the most Religious Emperor <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine,</hi> who has conven'd us out of divers Cities and Provinces, a holy and great Council is celebrated at <hi>Nice;</hi> we have thought it necessary, that Letters should be sent to you from the whole sacred Synod, that you may understand both what has been propounded and debated, and what has been agreed upon and decreed. First then the impious Cause of <hi>Arius</hi> and his Associates, was discuss'd in the presence of the most Religious Emperor, and by universal suffrage his ungodly Principles were condemned, yea and the very blasphemous Words and Phrases, that he makes use of to express them, when he affirms, <hi>that the Son of God sprang out of nothing,</hi> and that <hi>there was a time, when he was not,</hi> and that <hi>according to the freedom of his Will, he is capable of Vice and Vertue,</hi> not scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling to call him a Creature, and the Workmanship of God. All which the holy Synod, being no longer able to bear such Impiety and Madness, nor to hear such blasphemous Expressions, has anathematiz'd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd. And indeed what has been determin'd concerning him, you have either heard already, or will hear shortly; that we may not seem to insult over a man, who has received such a recompence as his Crimes deserved. Nay, so venomous and malignant was his Impiety, as to draw <hi>Theonas</hi> Bishop of <hi>Marmarica,</hi> and <hi>Secundus</hi> of <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> along with him into the same ruine. The same Sentence that passed upon him, being passed also against them. But forasmuch as when the grace of God, had delivered them from the blasphemy and impiety of this wretched Opinion, and from those Persons who feared not to raise Dissentions and Divisions amongst a People formerly living in Peace and Ʋnity; the boldness and contumacy of <hi>Meletius,</hi> and those that had been ordained by him did still continue; we give you to understand, dear Brethren, what the Synod has determined in this Matter. It seemed good then (the Council dealing more tenderly with him, for in strict Justice he deserved no pitty) that <hi>Meletius</hi> should reside in his own City, but have no Power either of electing, or laying on of hands; nor should, upon that account, appear in any Town or City, and should only retain the venerable title of Bishop. And as for those that have been ordained by him, being confirmed by a more holy and warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Ordination, they are to be admitted to Communion, with this conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they retain their Dignity, and their Office, but be ever placed after all those, whom our much honoured Collegue <hi>Alexander,</hi> has at any time before ordained, in what Church or Diocess soever they be. And as to these Persons, they shall have no Power to choose whom they please, or to propound any one's name in order to it, or indeed to do any thing at all without the consent of the Bishops of the Catholick Church, that are under <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Jurisdiction. But where any by the grace of God, and the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49523:96"/> assistance of your Prayers shall be found not to have been guilty of any Schism, but to have continued unblameable in the Catholick and Apostolick Church, let them have power of electing and propounding the names of such Persons as are fit to be admitted into the Clergy, and of doing all other things accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Rules and Canons of the Church. And if any of them that are in the Church chance to dye, let them who were lately taken in, be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced into the Place and Dignity of the Person deceased, alwayes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that they appear worthy, and that the People choose; but withall, that the Bishop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> consent to, and ratifie the Election. And the same is to be granted to all others. As for <hi>Meletius</hi> himself, it has pleas'd the Synod, not to deal altogether so favourably with him, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering his former Contumacy, and the rash and precipitate Humour of the man, he should be intrusted with no Power or Authority, whereby he may again be capable to raise the same Stirs and Tumults that he did before. These are the things that peculiarly concern <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the most holy Church of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> If there be any thing else decreed or desired, while our Lord and reverend Colleague and Brother <hi>Alexander</hi> is present with us, he himself at his return shall acquaint you with it more particularly, he being chief Author and Actor of what is transacted here. We give you likewise to understand, of the Agreement about the most holy Feast of <hi>Easter,</hi> that by the assistance of your Prayers, this Affair is happily ended; and that all the Brethren in the <hi>East,</hi> who beforetime celebrated it after the <hi>Jewish</hi> Custom, will henceforth unanimously celebrate it agreeably to the usage of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and to us, and to all that from all Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity have kept it as we do. Rejoyce therefore for this happy settlement of Affairs, and both for the common Peace and Agreement, and for that all Heresie is cut off, receive our Colleague, and your Bishop, <hi>Alexander</hi> with greater Demonstrations of Honour, Respect, and Love, who has both by his presence added great Contentment and Satisfaction to us, and even at this Age has sustained infinite and indefatigable Pains, that Peace and Ʋnity might be restored to you. Pray for us all, that those things that have been well constituted, may remain firm and intire through the blessing of Almighty God, and our Lord Jesus Christ, being ordained, as we verily believe, according to the good pleasure of God the Father in the holy Spirit. To whom be Glory for ever and ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>

Which was no sooner done, but it was entertain'd with the universal Joy and Satisfaction both of the Clergy and People, manifested by all open signs of Festivity and Rejoycing, chearful Looks, general Confluences to behold the man, and common Gratulations and Thanks to God for so great a Blessing. So spiteful and groundless was the Calumny of the <hi>Arians</hi> (as the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Bishops, some of which were present, and did assist at his Ordination, in their Synodical Epistle do observe) that when upon <hi>Alexander</hi>'s death,<note n="h" place="margin">Loc. cit. vid.

                        </gap>, but after a Divine and Apostolick manner. His Succession hapned about the beginning of the year CCCXXVI. at which time he must be very young, not above XXVIII. years of Age. For his childish personat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Office of a Bishop (when we cannot well suppose him above thirteen or fourteen years old at most) not hapning till <hi>Alexander</hi> was Bishop of that Church; and <hi>Alexander</hi> not being advanc'd to that See, till towards the latter end of <hi>Ann.</hi> CCCXII. the remainder till the year after the <hi>Nicene</hi> Synod, will but barely make up the Account. An Age not very consistent with the ordinary Customs and Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Church. But it was thought fit it seems for once, rather to dispence with the Rules of Ecclesiastick Discipline, than that, at this time especially, the Church should want so extraordinary a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, so admirably fit and useful to the present State and Exigencies of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:49523:99"/> that Church. All which is said upon the supposal that the Story of his childish playing the Bishop, is certain and unquestionable, which though transmitted to us by a great cloud of Witnesses, yet is the whole Evidence founded upon the single Authority of <hi>Rufinus,</hi> who 'tis plain, was the first reporter of the Story, a man infinitely careless in his accounts of things, and who took up this only as a popular Tradition at near an hundred years distance from the thing it self. And if that Story be set aside, then may <hi>Athanasius</hi> his Birth be carried back into part of the foregoing <hi>Saeculum,</hi> and a more competent Age allow'd him at the time of his Ordination. And indeed it seems very strange, that the <hi>Arians</hi> who narrowly ransack'd all the Passages of his Life, and particularly objected, or rather feigned other Irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities of his Ordination, should never mention the Incompetency of his years for so great and eminent a Station, especially when it seem'd to be against the Apostles own Canon, and the ordinary Rules and Practice of the Church. But herein I determine nothing, but leave the Reader to the conduct of his own Judgment, not being willing needlesly to shake the credit of any part of Church-History.</p>

Wherefore they resolv'd to unite all their Powers against him. And to strengthen their Interest, no way appear'd more fair and plausible, than to draw over the <hi>Meletians</hi> to their Party; a Body of men nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, and by reason of the Orthodoxy of their Principles, of no inconsiderable Reputation with the People.

Whereupon he dispatch'd away <hi>Macarius</hi> his Presbyter, and the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter of the Place, to enquire into the Matter, and to summon the Person.

Failing in this, he went to work another way, by crafty Insinuations engaging the Emperor, who now look'd upon <hi>Arius,</hi> as conforming himself to the Church, to write in his behalf to <hi>Athanasius,</hi> which he did,<note n="y" place="margin">Ext.

In which clause of the Letter (for part of it only is set down) no particular mention being made of <hi>Arius,</hi> probable it is, that <hi>Eusebius</hi> had couch'd the Design only in general Terms, representing <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius</hi> as an Enemy to the Peace and Union of the Church. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever trusting in the goodness of his Cause, he was nothing startled at this quick and severe Message of the Emperor, humbly remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strating by his Answer, that the Catholick Church could not possibly hold Communion with that Heresie, that plainly subverted the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of our Saviour. <hi>Eusebius</hi> disappointed in both these attempts, falls now to downright Methods of Fraud and Falshood, resolving by right or wrong to remove him, who so long as he stood in their way, would obstruct whatever they took in hand. And first he sends to the <hi>Meletians,</hi> that now was a fit time to put their confederate Councils into Practice; who partly encourag'd by his Letters, partly to sollicit their own Cause, <hi>viz.</hi> the Restitution of their Churches, deputed three Bishops of their Party, <hi>Isio, Eudaemon,</hi> and <hi>Callinicus,</hi> to go and manage their Affairs at Court, where, by <hi>Eus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

For procuring a Synod to be call'd at <hi>Antioch, Eustathius</hi> is charg'd as Heterodox in the Faith; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they knew that too thin to hold Water, they back'd it with the Accusation of Adultery, which they procur'd to be depos'd upon Oath, though but the Oath of a lewd infamous Woman. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the good man was condemn'd, and thrown out of his See. And though there were those in the Council, who smelt the Knavery, and perswaded <hi>Eustathius</hi> not to stand to the Sentence of Deposition, yet were their Enemies too quick for them, having immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed notice of it to the Emperor, to whom they represented the Scandal of the Crimes, and the great Justice of the Sentence, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading the Emperor to confirm it, who accordingly ordered him to be banish'd.</p>

By his contrivance Accusations are fram'd, and brought into more formal and plausible Stories; <hi>Athanasius</hi> is charg'd with cruel and tyrannical Actings, <hi>Macarius</hi> his Presbyter as sent by him with forcible rushing into the Chancel, breaking the Communion-Cup, and tearing the Bible in pieces, <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius</hi> indicted of Murder, for making away <hi>Arsenius</hi> a <hi>Meletian</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, and a dead man's hand produc'd as evidence of the Fact, whereof more in their due place. All which were represented with their greatest Aggravations to the Emperor. The first he slighted, having himself heard it sufficiently baffled, when <hi>Athanasius,</hi> not long since, appear'd before him at <hi>Nicomedia.</hi> For that of <hi>Arsenius,</hi> which seem'd to be of most moment, he sent to his Brother <hi>Dalmatius</hi> the <hi>Censor,</hi> then residing at <hi>Antioch,</hi> to take the matter under Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The <hi>Censor</hi> presently writes to <hi>Athanasius,</hi> commanding him to prepare himself for a Tryal, and to answer the things laid to his Charge. He, conscious of his own Innocency, and the prodigious Malignity of the Fable, at first made light of it, but considering that the Emperor had concern'd himself in it, he thought it not safe to neglect it. Wherefore he wrote to the Bishops of his Diocess, to give them notice of it, and sent a Deacon to enquire after <hi>Arsenius,</hi> whom with much ado he found to be alive and well. Which was no sooner done, but he dispatch'd away <hi>Macarius</hi> with Letters to the Emperor at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> to give hm a true account of the State of things, to put him in mind of what had been transacted at <hi>Psammathia,</hi> and to assure him that <hi>Arsenius</hi> after all was alive and safe. The Emperor wondring at mens immoderate boldness and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, commanded <hi>Dalmatius</hi> to surcease the Process, and the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusers who had been sent into the <hi>East</hi> to manage the Charge, to depart from Court, himself writing<note n="d" place="margin">Ext.

To effect which, they put it into the Emperor's head, that his stately Buildings at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> were now almost finished, and ripe for Dedication, for which the Bishops of those Parts must be call'd together, that this opportunity might be taken first to settle and compose those Differences, which of late had so much disturb'd the Church, that so they might more unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously carry on that great Solemnity. To this the Emperor at length yielded, appointing a Synod<note n="f" place="margin">Soz. l. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>25.</hi> p. <hi>479.</hi> Theod. l. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>28.</hi> p. <hi>61.</hi>

Though indeed <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi> assigns no such Reason, nor is this Synod so much as once men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd by him.

                     <p n="2">II. <hi>ATHANASIƲS</hi> being brought before the Council, had the Portion of a Criminal to stand at the Bar, which so incens'd <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamon</hi> one of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Bishops, that he fell foul upon <hi>Eusebius</hi> of <hi>Caesarea,</hi> one of the Synod, when he espy'd him sitting upon the Bench, while <hi>Athanasius</hi> stood below, reproaching him with some Suspitions of idolatrous Compliance, while they had been Fellow-Prisoners under the <hi>Diocletian</hi> Persecution. <hi>Athanasius</hi> at first demur'd, though not to the Jurisdiction of the Court, yet to the competency and fitness of his Judges; which Exception not being admitted, his Indictment was read, and his Crimes openly mention'd. Now the things laid to his charge, were especially of two sorts, Matters of Vice and Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, and Matters of Impiety and Prophanation; for as for the stale Accusations of Treason and Sedition, the levying an Imposition of Linnen Cloth upon the People, and conspiring with <hi>Philumenus</hi> to invade the Empire, they had been so notoriously baffled in former attempts, that I find them not so much as once mention'd in the Synod, though to add what colour they could to their Sentence, they charge<note n="k" place="margin">Soz. ib. p. <hi>482</hi>
                        </note> him with Contumacy, in refusing to obey the Emperor's Edict, commanding him to appear the year before in the Synod at <hi>Caesarea,</hi> and that he had now brought so many Attendants with him to <hi>Tyre,</hi> as if he intended to offer force and violence to the Council. We shall a little more particularly enquire into the things charg'd upon him, because objected against him, not only in this, but in some after-Synods.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. IN reference to Vice and Immorality, he stood indicted of three great Crimes,<note n="l" place="margin">Soz. ib. p. <hi>479.</hi>
                        </note> Oppression, Ravishment, and Murder. Under the first he was charg'd with cruel and tyrannical Usage of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that he had often fetter'd <hi>Ischyras,</hi> and having accus'd him before <hi>Hyginus</hi> Praefect of <hi>Egypt,</hi> for throwing Stones at the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror's Statues, had caus'd him to be cast into Prison; that he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd <hi>Callinicus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Pelusium</hi> for refusing to communicate with him, and given his Church to one <hi>Marke,</hi> a degraded Presbyter, nay

But seeing these things in all likelyhood wanted proof, no more than the bare mention of them being record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that some of them depending upon other parts of the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, fell together with them, it would be needless to insist upon them. The next branch of the Charge concern'd Force and Ravish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that he had offered violence to a Woman,<note n="n" place="margin">Ruffin. H.

The Judges calling upon <hi>Athanasius</hi> to answer the matter of Fact alledg'd against him he stood silent, but <hi>Timotheus</hi> turning to the Woman, <hi>Woman</hi> (said he) <hi>was I ever in your House, did I ever, as you pretend, offer violence to you?</hi> To which, with some quickness and vehemency she replied, stretching out her hand, and pointing to him with her fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, yes, yes, you are the man, that forcibly press'd upon me, and stain'd my Chastity and my Honour; adding, as in such Cases is usual, both the time and place. The Cheat thus plainly discovering it self, put the Contrivers of it to the blush; and when <hi>Athanasius</hi> requir'd, that before the Woman was dismiss'd, she might be ask'd, who 'twas that had fram'd and laid the Plot, his just request was over-rul'd by a clamorous Answer, that they had greater Matters against him to be examin'd, and for which they had Evidence beyond all Exception. This Passage, <hi>Sozomen</hi> tells us, was not recorded in the Acts of the Council, as being thought too light and immodest for the Transactions of a grave Assembly. Nor is it to be forgotten, that the <hi>Arian</hi> Historian<note n="o" place="margin">Philost. ubi sup<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </note> turns the Tale quite the other way, affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>Athanasius</hi> complotted with the Woman, and that by his direction she charg'd her great Belly upon <hi>Eusebius</hi> of <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> his chief Enemy in the Synod, who by a much like Stratagem brought it to light. But how much stress is to be laid upon his Relations, especially when levell'd against the Catholick Party, the judicious Reader needs not be told. And perhaps it might not be the least en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to the <hi>Arian</hi> Faction, to shift the Scene, and turn it upon <hi>Athanasius,</hi> that they knew that these Proceedings were not entred amongst the Acts of the Synod, and that there was nothing extant upon Record to disprove them.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. BUT that which of all others gave the most pleasant Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to the Synod (those only excepted who had contriv'd it) was the Tragy-Comick Scene of <hi>Arsenius</hi> the <hi>Meletian</hi> Bishop, the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of whom was charg'd<note n="p" place="margin">Socr. l. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>27.</hi> p. <hi>65.</hi> Sozom. &amp; Theod. loc. cit.</note> upon <hi>Athanasius,</hi> for proof whereof they produc'd a Box, out of which they took a dead man's Hand, dried and salted, which they affirm'd to be the Hand of <hi>Arsenius</hi> whom <hi>Athanasius</hi> had made away; and to make the wickedness still more enormous, added, that he had done it to Magical Purposes, to make
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:49523:104"/> use of it in Arts of diabolick Conjurations. The Truth and Validity of which Charge, will best appear by a short Survey of the whole Matter. <hi>Arsenius,</hi> who stiles himself Bishop of <hi>Hypsele,</hi> whereof <hi>Meletius</hi> himself had been sometimes Bishop, having fallen under some great Irregularity, had to avoid<note n="q" place="margin">Soz. ib. c. <hi>23.</hi> p. <hi>475.</hi>
                        </note> the Conviction and Censure of his Metropolitan, withdrawn himself. This opportunity <hi>John,</hi> the chief of the <hi>Meletian</hi> Party, thought fit to embrace, to fasten a most desperate Calumny upon <hi>Athanasius.</hi> For which end he and his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates find out the Man, treat him with all kindness and courtesie, perswade him still to conceal himself, lodging him to that purpose with one <hi>Pinnes,</hi> one of their Confidents, Presbyter of a Monastery in <hi>Thebais.</hi> This done, they give it out<note n="r" place="margin">Ath. Apol. <hi>II.</hi> p. <hi>606.</hi>
                        </note> in all publick places, that <hi>Athanasius</hi> had privately murdered <hi>Arsenius,</hi> shewing about a dead man's Hand, which they affirm'd to be his. The News hereof was not long, before it was by the <hi>Eusebians</hi> convey'd to the Emperor, who gave order to his Brother <hi>Dalmatius,</hi> to enquire into it. And though upon notice given him by the <hi>Censor,</hi> he slighted the Matter, as a thing sufficiently improbable in it self, yet knowing the Malice and Subtlety of his Enemies, and that the Emperor had taken Cognizance of it, he thought it not prudent to be unprepar'd for his own defence. Immediately therefore he sent one of his Deacons into <hi>Thebais</hi> to search for <hi>Arsenius,</hi> whom he had not seen in many years. The Deacon by the help of <hi>Pecysius, Sylvanus,</hi> and some other Monks, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood at length where he lay conceal'd. But coming to <hi>Pinnes</hi> his Monastery, and entring the House, they found indeed, that he had been there, but that the Bird was flown. For upon the first News of their arrival in those Parts, <hi>Pinnes</hi> had clapt him aboard, and by the assistance of <hi>Helias</hi> a Monk, had convey'd him down into the lower <hi>Egypt.</hi> Missing the man, they however seiz'd upon <hi>Pinnes</hi> and <hi>Helias,</hi> whom they brought to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and presented to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, before whom they freely confess'd that <hi>Arsenius</hi> was alive and well, and that <hi>Athanasius</hi> was guiltless and Innocent, as <hi>Pinnes</hi> himself tells <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Meletian</hi> Bishop in his Letter<note n="s" place="margin">Ext. ap. Ath. ib. p. <hi>608.</hi>
                        </note> to him. All which <hi>Athanasius</hi> presently certified to the Emperor, who by his answer testified how severely he resented the unjust Proceedings of that tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent and malicious Party.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. AND thus stood things till the Synod at <hi>Tyre,</hi> when this wretched device was again dress'd up, and brought upon the Stage; at which time the Providence of God strangely furnish'd him with an opportunity to silence the Malice of his Adversaries beyond all possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of Evasion. The <hi>Meletians</hi> had strictly charg'd<note n="t" place="margin">Socr. l. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>29.</hi> p. <hi>66.</hi> vid.

                        <hi>Arsenius</hi> to keep close; but he tempted with curiosity to see how things went, had privately convey'd himself to <hi>Tyre,</hi> intending to lye there <hi>Incog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nito</hi> all the time. It hapned that some Servants belonging to <hi>Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi> the Governor being then at the Tavern, heard a rumor whis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, that <hi>Arsenius</hi> was then in Town. Which they immediately told their Lord, who with equal secrecy and diligence found him out and apprehended him, giving notice of it to <hi>Athanasius.</hi> The man unwilling to be false to those that imploy'd him, and loth that the whole frame of the Plot should be reveal'd and unravel'd in a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, at first denied himself to be <hi>Arsenius,</hi> till <hi>Paul</hi> Bishop of <hi>Tyre,</hi> who had formerly known him, convinc'd him, and beat him out of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:49523:104"/> that refuge. The day of the Tryal being come, and the Case of the impudent Strumpet dismiss'd, this of <hi>Arsenius</hi> was brought on, the Prosecutors boasting, that now they should make not their Ears, but their very Eyes Judges in the Case, therewith producing the dead Hand, which they said <hi>Athanasius</hi> had dismembred. At which a great shout was made in the Synod, many believing it to be true, and others, that nothing could appear to the contrary. Silence being made, <hi>Athanasius</hi> gravely ask'd the Judges, Whether any of them knew <hi>Arsenius?</hi> which when several affirm'd, he commanded him to be brought into Court, and again ask'd, Whether this was the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, the man whom he was charg'd to have kill'd, and cut off his Hand? The Case being too notorious to be denied, while men were in a strange surprize and suspence about it, <hi>Athanasius</hi> turns back the man's Cloak, and shews them one of his Hands; and after a little pause, to give them time to suspect it might be the other hand, he puts back the other side of the Cloak, and shews the other: <hi>And now Gentlemen</hi> (said he) Arsenius <hi>you see has both his hands, but where a third hand is to be had that was cut off, I leave to my Accusers to discover.</hi> Thus ended the Plot, not more to the Pleasure and Satisfaction of the Innocent, than to the Shame and Confusion of the Guilty, amongst which <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Meletian</hi> Bishop, the main Contriver of the whole Scheme, is said to have slunk away in the Crowd, though others, as <hi>Theodorit</hi> tells us,<note n="u" place="margin">Ʋbi supr. p. <hi>64.</hi>
                        </note> stood to it, railing upon <hi>Athanasius</hi> for a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurer, and affirming that by Magick Arts he had cast a Mist before the Eyes of the Council, endeavouring to exasperate the Assembly to tear him in pieces, insomuch that had he not been rescued, the Comick Scene had been turn'd into a real Tragedy. While others studied to devise<note n="w" place="margin">Soz. loc. cit. p. <hi>481.</hi>
                        </note> something that might look like a plausible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse, saying with equal Truth, that <hi>Plusianus</hi> an <hi>Athanasian</hi> Bishop had by his command set on fire <hi>Arsenius</hi> his House, tied him to a Pillar and whipped him, and then shut him up in Prison; but that escaping out of a Window, he had a long time hid himself, which caus'd them to imagine him to be dead, and being a considerable Person, they thought they could do no less than bring his Cause before the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate, that it might be examin'd and sifted out. I add no more concerning this, than that <hi>Arsenius</hi> himself, together with his Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters and Deacons, wrote<note n="x" place="margin">Ext. Epist ap. Ath. ubi supr. p. <hi>610.</hi>
                        </note> to <hi>Athanasius</hi> to be receiv'd to the Peace and Unity of the Church, renouncing all Commerce with schismatical or heretical Persons, and promising all Canonical Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection and Obedience to him as their lawful Metropolitan; desiring him to write to them, and to give notice of their intire Agreement with the Catholick Church. Nay <hi>John</hi> himself repenting of what he had done, confess'd the Injuries that had been done to <hi>Athanasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> and reconcil'd himself to him, as himself witnessed in his Letter to the Emperor, whereof <hi>Constantine</hi> gives an account in his answer<note n="y" place="margin">Ext. ib. p. <hi>611</hi>
                        </note> to him.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. WE have seen with what success the Charge of Vice and Immorality was manag'd against this good man; let us next see how he sped in that of Impiety and Profanation, wherein two Articles especially were insisted on. First, that he had procur'd himself<note n="z" place="margin">Soz. ubi supr. p. <hi>480.</hi>
                        </note> to be created Bishop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> by undue and unlawful means, that the Persons ordaining him, were in the very Act guilty of Perjury,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:49523:105"/> all the Bishops having bound themselves, that no man should be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd, 'till he had clear'd himself of what could be objected against him; that being thus deceiv'd, they had renounc'd Communion with him, who yet was so far from giving them Satisfaction, that he forcibly compell'd, and cast them into Prison. To which purpose a Libel was read in the Synod, containing some popular Exceptions, as if for his sake the People of <hi>Alexandria</hi> had forsaken the publick Assemblies. The Falsehood of all which is sufficiently evident from the manner of his coming to that See, the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Synod (many whereof assisted at his Consecration) declaring<note n="a" place="margin">Ap. Ath. Apol. <hi>II.</hi> p. <hi>565, 566.</hi>
                        </note> before the whole World, that he was elected by common Suffrage and Consent, and ordained at the unwearied instance and importunity of the People, and that his entrance upon it was so far from being entertained with Tumults and Murmuring, that it was celebrated with popular Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs and Thanks to God. But that which made a louder noise, was the other Branch of the Charge,<note n="b" place="margin">Socr. ib. p. <hi>64.</hi> Sozom. p. <hi>479.</hi>
                        </note>
                        <hi>viz.</hi> that his Presbyter <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carius</hi> at his command, and by his Authority, had forcibly broken into the Chancel, while <hi>Ischyras</hi> was officiating in the holy Ministrations, that he had overturn'd the Communion-Table, broken in pieces the Sacramental Chalice, and burnt the holy Books. All which <hi>Ischyras</hi> was there present to attest.

                        </note> that this <hi>Ischyras,</hi> whom the Indictment presented in the capacity of a Priest, was really no Presbyter, nor ever so accounted by any, but his own Relations, that he pretended to no better Orders, than what <hi>Collu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus</hi> had confer'd upon him, who was himself but a Presbyter, and who for usurping the Office of a Bishop, had been Synodically cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured, and the Persons ordained by him reduced into the Order and Class of Laicks; that when <hi>Macarius</hi> came thither, <hi>Ischyras</hi> was sick<note n="d" place="margin">Athan. ib. p. <hi>589, 581.</hi>

                        </note> what <hi>Ischyras</hi> said was false; that the Presbyters and Deacons of that Country, who had accompanied <hi>Athanasius</hi> in his Visitation, were his Compurgators, solemnly protesting that there was no such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and that the whole of the Story was forged and fabulous; fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, that <hi>Ischyras</hi> himself had confessed<note n="h" place="margin">

                        </note> under his own Hand, delivered in the presence of six Presbyters, and eight Deacons, whose names are to it, declaring that he was set on, yea by stripes forced to it by <hi>Heraclides, Isaac,</hi> and the rest of their Associates, and that he called God to witness, that he knew nothing of the things charg'd upon <hi>Athanasius,</hi> but that he had been compelled to give what Testimony he had done, and that he thought himself obliged to
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:49523:105"/> make this Declaration, heartily wishing he might be admitted to Communion with him.</p>
                     <p n="7">VII. THE Case being thus clear (most of these things being no doubt then pleaded by <hi>Athanasius</hi>) his Accusers were at a stand, and knew not what course to take, till those<note n="k" place="margin">Socr. l. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>31.</hi> p. <hi>67.</hi>
                        </note> who were confederate in the Council, put the Matter upon this Issue, that the Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Case should be suspended, and that Commissioners should be sent into <hi>Egypt,</hi> to enquire into the true State of the Case, and to report it to the Synod, nominating to that end such as they could trust, <hi>Theognis</hi> Bishop of <hi>Nice, Maris</hi> of <hi>Calcedon, Theodore</hi> of <hi>Perin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus, Macedonius</hi> of <hi>Mopsus</hi> in <hi>Cilicia, Ʋrsacius</hi> of <hi>Singidunum</hi> in <hi>Maesia,</hi> and <hi>Valens</hi> of <hi>Mursa</hi> in <hi>Pannonia,</hi> who together with <hi>Ischyras</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently betook themselves to the Voyage. By this <hi>Athanasius</hi> perceiv'd which way things were like to go, but not to be wanting to his Cause, he put in his Exceptions against the Commission, which he affirm'd<note n="l" place="margin">Ath. ubi supr. p. <hi>612.</hi>
                        </note> to be altogether needless, things being plain enough already, that the Design of it was only to gain time, and that 'twas in vain to go so far about to do what they had already resolv'd should be done. But this not being admitted, he next excepted against the Persons, alledging it to be highly unreasonable, that when <hi>Macarius</hi> was kept Prisoner at <hi>Tyre, Ischyras</hi> should be taken along with the Delegates, who themselves were all sworn Enemies, by which might be guess'd what return was like to be made. And though this Exception was infinitely equitable, yet the Count <hi>Dionysius</hi> suffered them to depart. This procedure gave just distast to all that were Friends to the <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasian</hi> Cause, the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Bishops not long after presenting a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station<note n="m" place="margin">Ext. ib. p. <hi>616</hi>

Bishops, wherein they smartly complained of the fraudulent and mischievous Designs of the <hi>Eusebian</hi> Party in the Synod, their unjust Proceedings against <hi>Athanasius,</hi> their unfair Attempts to engage the rest of the Council to own and subscribe their Transactions, against which they thought it their Duty to protest, and to beseech them by all that was sacred, not to concur with them, as they would answer the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary in the great day of their Accounts. This they back'd with an Address<note n="n" place="margin">Ext. ib. p. <hi>618</hi>

According to the command of your devout Piety, we have, Sir, explained the Faith we hold, and by this writing do in the presence of God profess, that both we our selves, and all that are of our Party, do believe according to the Tenor of the Confession following. We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, and in our Lord Jesus Christ his Son, begotten of him before all Worlds, being God the Word, by whom all things were made both in Heaven and Earth; who came down from Heaven, and was incarnate, suffered, and rose again, and ascended into Heaven, and shall come again to judge the quick and the dead. And in the holy Ghost; the Resurrection of the flesh, the life of the World to come, the Kingdom of Heaven, and in one Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:49523:107"/> Church of God, dispersed from one end of the World to the other. This Faith we have received out of the holy Gospel, especially that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of our Lord to his Apostles, go ye, and teach all Nations; baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Ghost.</hi> And these things they professed they believed, and that they really owned the Father, Son, and holy Ghost, according to the Doctrine of the Scriptures, and the Faith of the whole Catholick Church; which if we do not ('tis their own <hi>Anathema</hi> in their own Words) God be our Judge both in this World, and in that to come. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they pray that by his Mediation they might be united to the Church their Mother, and that all needless Questions and Disputes laid aside, they might peaceably accord, and unanimously pray for his Majesties Prosperity and Safety.</p>

Hereof <hi>Eusebius</hi> complained at Court, beseeching the Emperor to write in his behalf. Notwithstanding whose powerful Intercession <hi>Athanasius</hi> absolutely refus'd to admit the man to Communion, writing back to the Emperor, that they who had once violated and denied the Faith, and had been cast out of the Church, could not easily be taken in again to an intire Communion.

Which the Emperor look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon as a piece of common Justice, dispatched away a Letter<note n="m" place="margin">Ext. ap. Socr. &amp; Soz. loc. cit.

And when <hi>Athanasius</hi> urged this to be highly incredible, it being alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether improbable, that so poor and inconsiderable a Person as he was, should be able to do this; <hi>Eusebius</hi> replied, and confirmed it with an Oath, that <hi>Athanasius</hi> was Rich, and had Power and Interest enough to effect what he had threatened. The Emperor giving cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to the Reporters of the Story, expressed a just Resentment at it, as Princes are never more tender and jealous, than of the Rights and Priviledges of their Crowns, and forthwith commanded<note n="o" place="margin">Socr. &amp; Soz. loc. cit.

                        </note> us, that he remain'd in the Parts of <hi>Italy</hi> more than XII. or XIV. years. A mistake not capable of excuse any other way (and that too lame and unsatisfactory) than by saying, that he meant it of the several Banishments which <hi>Athanasius</hi> underwent from first to last. But we have formerly remark'd, that of all others, he is the most loose and careless Relator of these Matters.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. FURNISHED with this royal Warrant, <hi>Athanasius</hi> puts himself upon his Journey, passing through <hi>Syria,</hi> and so to <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> welcome we may be sure to the People of his Charge,<note n="s" place="margin">Theod. l. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>2.</hi> p. <hi>70.</hi>

All this the <hi>Arians</hi> beheld with an envious and evil Eye, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to prevent his coming back, were resolv'd to make it uneasie to him. To which end they endeavoured to spoil the Triumphs of his return, by blowing up People into Tumults and Disorders, on purpose that hence they might have some pretext of improving it into a formal Charge and Accusation, which they did shortly after, by means of their potent Friends above. For the <hi>Eusebian</hi> Faction at this time rul'd all in the Court of <hi>Constantius,</hi> to whose share the <hi>Eastern</hi> part of the Empire fell. First<note n="t" place="margin">Socr. l. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>2.</hi> p. <hi>81.</hi> Soz. l. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>1.</hi> p. <hi>497.</hi>
                        </note> they gain'd <hi>Eusebius</hi> the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> great Chamberlain of the Palace, to their side, and by him the rest of the <hi>Eunuchs,</hi> men of greatest note and favour with the Emperor. Next they recommended their Opinions, and the Merit of their Cause to the Empress, and last of all prevail'd with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, who being a young Prince, and of an easie and credulous Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, was without any difficulty brought over to them. And now the Cause began to run smooth, and to be freely vented without controul. The Emperor's Guards were able to tell you how the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:49523:112"/> Case stood between <hi>Athanasius</hi> and his Adversaries; the Eunuchs and Court-Ladies held chat, and confidently disputed the most profound Points of Faith, nay scarce a corner in the City, where the meanest Mechanick would not take upon him to argue <hi>Pro</hi> or <hi>Con</hi> in these weighty Matters. And this License soon spread it self into other Parts, till from enquiring they fell to disputing, and that turn'd to wrangling, which ended at length in more fatal Feuds and Quarrels.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. HAVING thus successfully setled and secured their Interests at Court, they fall more directly upon <hi>Athanasius,</hi> whom they accuse to the Emperor of all the Crimes that had been charg'd upon him in the time of <hi>Constantine,</hi> with some few Matters of later date, of equal Truth and Credit with the rest. And not content to assault him at home, they next attempt to ruine his Reputation abroad, writing Letters<note n="u" place="margin">Epist. Synod. Alex. ap. Ath. Apol. <hi>II.</hi> p. <hi>562. &amp;c.</hi> vid. Theod. ib. c. <hi>3.</hi> p. <hi>71.</hi>
                        </note> to that purpose to <hi>Constantine</hi> and <hi>Constans,</hi> the two other imperial Brothers, wherein they set forth at large all the Evils and Mischiefs which they could with any pretence heap upon him from his first entrance upon the See of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merating those several absurd and foolish Accusations that had been manag'd against him with so much heat in the Synod of <hi>Tyre;</hi> to which they now add, that he had insolently taken upon him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn without leave; that having been Synodically condemn'd, and thereupon banish'd by the Emperor, he had resum'd his Place with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Synodical Sentence of Absolution; that his return was so distastful to the People, that it hurried all things into a general Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult and Confusion, whence ensued blood and slaughter, charging him with things done by the Governor of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> before he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd thither, yea that he himself had commanded some to be beaten, others to be brought to Trial, and cast into Prison; and that not <hi>Egypt</hi> only, but <hi>Palaestine, Phaenicia,</hi> and the neighbour Provinces were likely to be involv'd in the same Storm and Tempest. The same they writ to <hi>Julius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> desiring that he would ratifie and confirm the Sentence which the Council of <hi>Tyre</hi> had given against him. The chief Actors in this Affair were <hi>Theognis</hi> Bishop of <hi>Nice, Theodore</hi> of <hi>Heraclea,</hi> and (who acted all the rest) <hi>Eusebius,</hi> tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated about this time from <hi>Nicomedia</hi> to the See of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> in the room of <hi>Paulus,</hi> now again ejected and banish'd by the prevalency of the <hi>Arian</hi> Party.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. OF all these Transactions <hi>Athanasius</hi> had quick Intelligence, and finding from what Quarter the Wind blew, thought it high time to provide against the Storm which he saw coming upon him. To this end he first conven'd the Bishops of <hi>Egypt, Thebais, Libya,</hi> and <hi>Pentapolis,</hi> who met in Synod at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> to the number of near an hundred, unanimously agreeing to vindicate the Innocency of their Metropolitan, conceiving themselves most properly capable to give Testimony in this Case, as being nearest to the Stage of Action, and many of them Eye-witnesses of the most material Passages, whereof <hi>Athanasius</hi> stood accus'd. Immediately therefore they write an <hi>Ency<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clical</hi> Epistle<note n="w" place="margin">Ext. ap. Ath. ubi supra.</note> to all the Bishops of the Catholick Church, wherein they complain of the Fraud and Malice of his Enemies, solemnly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare against those Scandals and Calumnies which they had cast upon him, particularly refute the several Misdemeanors, wherewith in the late Letters to the Emperors, and the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> he had
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:49523:112"/> been charg'd, concluding with an earnest Importunity that they would receive this Testimony, and stand up for the Cause of <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius,</hi> and not give credit to the wicked and fraudulent Suggestions of his Adversaries, who boggled at no wayes, how leud soever, to advance their Cause; but especially impos'd upon them in the matter of Subscriptions; the names of <hi>Egyptian</hi> Bishops wherein they so much gloried, not being Catholicks, but <hi>Meletian</hi> Schismaticks, who notoriously disturb'd the Peace of the Church, and were Guilty of worse things than they were willing to commit to writing, an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count whereof they might receive from those who should deliver their Letter to them. Thus prepar'd, he forthwith dispatch'd away Messengers<note n="x" place="margin">Ath. ad Solit. p. <hi>631.</hi>
                        </note> to the Courts of the <hi>Western</hi> Emperors, where meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with those sent from the adverse Party, they so baffled their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, and plainly expos'd the Falshood of their Accusations, that they were forc'd to retire thence with shame.

                        </note> (whither they went also to carry the Synodical Epistle) they had frequent Meetings, where they found, that before their arrival, the <hi>Eusebian</hi> Messengers had been pressing <hi>Julius</hi> to own what had been done in the Synod at <hi>Tyre,</hi> desiring him for his Satisfaction in the Truth of things, to write to one <hi>Pistus</hi> at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> who would give him a faithful Relation of these Matters. Which they no sooner heard, but they acquainted <hi>Julius,</hi> that this <hi>Pistus</hi> was a professed <hi>Arian,</hi> and as such had been branded long since by <hi>Alexander</hi> their Bishop, and by the Synod of <hi>Nice,</hi> and that he had no other Orders, than what he had receiv'd from <hi>Secundus</hi> of <hi>Pentapolis,</hi> whom that great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil had rejected as an <hi>Arian</hi> Bishop. And indeed at all their Meetings, they still manag'd their Cause with so much clearness, and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulable Evidence, that <hi>Julius</hi> and all indifferent Persons were abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly satisfied in their accounts of things, which put <hi>Martyrius, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carius,</hi> and <hi>Hesychius,</hi> the <hi>Eusebian</hi> Legats, to such a plunge, that not well knowing what shift to make, they requested <hi>Julius,</hi> that a Council might be call'd about this Matter, and both Parties concernd summon'd to appear, that so the Case might be debated and decided in a just and an impartial Way, and that then they should be ready to make good whatever they had charg'd upon <hi>Athanasius.</hi> This, however intended by them only as a present shift, yet seeming fair and reasonable, was assented to, and the <hi>Eusebian</hi> Legats dismiss'd, or indeed rather they fled away by night, though sick and indispos'd, not able to bear the shame of such frequent and publick Refutations; <hi>Julius</hi> resolving to give their Masters notice of the time and place by Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of his own. Hereof he presently advertis'd <hi>Athanasius,</hi> referring it to him to appoint the place of the Synod, where he thought he might best appear and answer for himself with freedom and safety; sending him withall, a Copy<note n="z" place="margin">Ʋbi supr. p. <hi>620.</hi> vid. eti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am p. <hi>581.</hi>

This good success of his was yet about this time, or soon after, a little allay'd with the News of the death of his great Lord and Patron, <hi>Constantine</hi> the Emperor, the eldest of the three Brothers, who invading the Dominions of his Brother <hi>Constans,</hi> was himself kill'd in the attempt <hi>Ann.

For from the beginning we have been taught to believe in one God, the Maker and Preserver of all things both intelligible and sensible, and in one only begotten Son of God, subsisting before all Worlds, and abiding together with the Father that begat him; by whom all things were made, visible and invisible; who according to the Father's will, did in these last dayes come down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and took flesh of the Blessed Virgin, and when in all things he had fulfill'd his Father's Will, suffered, and rose again, and return'd to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and sits at the right hand of the Father. He will come again to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:49523:113"/> judge the quick and the dead, and being King and God, abides so for ever. We believe also in the holy Ghost. And if it be necessary to add, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve likewise the Resurrection of the flesh, and the life everlasting.</hi>

But this being thought too short and unsatisfactory, and the Sence of it obscure and ambiguous in the most important Articles, they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards published a larger Confession of their Faith<note n="i" place="margin">Ext. loc. cit.</note> in this Form. <hi>According to the Faith delivered by the Evangelists and Apostles, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker and Creator of all things; and in one Lord</hi> Jesus Christ, <hi>being God, his only begotten Son, by whom all things are made, begotten of his Father before all Worlds, God of God, whole of whole, alone of God alone, perfect of perfect, King of King, Lord of Lord, the living Word, true Wisdom, Life and Light, the way of Truth, the Resurrection, the Shepherd, the Door; unchangeable and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable, the most express and exact Image of his Father's Godhead, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, Power, Council, and Glory; the first-born of every Creature; he who in the beginning was with God, even God the Word, as it is said in the Gospel, and the Word was God, by whom all things were made, and in whom all things subsist. Who in these last dayes came down from Heaven, and was born of the Virgin</hi> Mary <hi>according to the Scriptures; and was made man, the Mediator between God and man, the Apostle of our Faith, and the Prince of life, as himself sayes, I came down from Heaven, not to do mine own Will, but the Will of him that sent me; who suffered for us, and rose again the third day, and ascended into Heaven, and sits at the right hand of the Father; and he shall come again with Glory and Power to judge the quick and the dead. And in the holy Ghost, which is given for Consolation, Sanctification, and Consummation to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; even as our Lord</hi> Jesus Christ <hi>commanded his Disciples, saying, go ye, and teach all Nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Ghost, plainly intimating the Father as truly a Father, the Son as truly a Son, and the holy Ghost as truly such: So as these are not meer simple Names, but such as accurately express each ones proper</hi> Hypostasis <hi>or Person, Order, and Glory: So that they are three in Person, but one in Consent. Holding therefore this Faith, which in the presence of God and Christ we have maintain'd from the first, and shall retain to the last, we under an</hi> Anathema <hi>condemn all perverse he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical Opinions. And if any one contrary to the orthodox Belief held forth in Scripture, shall teach and affirm, that</hi> there was any Time or Age, before the Son was begotten, <hi>let him be accursed. And if any shall affirm</hi> the Son to be a Creature, as one of the Creatures; <hi>or a Branch, as one of the Branches, and shall not hold all the things before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd, just as the holy Scriptures have delivered them; or shall teach or preach any other thing than what we have received, let him be accursed. For we for our Parts do truly and religiously believe and entertain all things delivered both by the Prophets and Apostles, and that are consign'd to us in the holy Scriptures.</hi>

The Truth is, they found a quite other face of things, than what they look'd for: they came with a confident Perswasion, that <hi>Athanasius</hi> durst not appear and abide a Trial, and were strangely surpriz'd, not only to find him here, but that he was prepar'd, and openly challeng'd them to a Tryal, they perceiv'd that things would be manag'd here according to the strict Rules of Ecclesiastick Discipline, that no force could be put upon the Synod, no Guards set at the Doors, no great men of their Party admitted from Court, who might awe and direct Proceedings; the usual Arts by which they had hitherto prevail'd, and for which end they had now brought with them Count <hi>Musonianus,</hi> and <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:49523:118"/> brought along with them the Chains and Instruments of Cruelty, wherewith they had been tortured, others shewing the Wounds and the Scars which they had received. The Friends and Kindred of those whom they had put to death, appear'd to exhibit their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, and Messengers came in the name of whole Churches to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present the Injuries and Sufferings which they had undergone from the Rage of the <hi>Arian</hi> Party. Nor did it a little sensibly touch them, that <hi>Arius</hi> and <hi>Asterius</hi> were gone over to the Synod, who had come along with them, and were privy to their most intimate Councils and Transactions. These things prophecied to them no good Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, they saw 'twas no purpose to let their Cause come to a fair open Trial, that <hi>Athanasius</hi> had all Acts ready that concern'd his Case, which would sufficiently blast and expose their Cause, and that they had no potent Friends in the Synod to support it: That therefore it was most advisable to break up and be gon, to prevent their being condemn'd upon the Place; that if they departed, they should find one means or another to propagate and uphold their Cause; and if the Synod should condemn them after their departure, they had a sure Friend of the Emperor, who, they doubted not, would protect and assist them.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. HEREUPON they shut themselves up in the Palace, where they were lodg'd, and where they dayly held their Consults. They were several times cited by the Synod to appear, and that with smart Provocations; if they came with a design to try the Merits of the Cause, why did they decline it? Either they should not have come at all, or being come, they could not without just disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to their Cause refuse it. <hi>Athanasius</hi> and his Brethren, whom they had so heavily charg'd, were there present, if they had any thing to object against them, they were requir'd to do it; if they had not, the Synod must proceed against them as false and unjust Accusers. <hi>Athanasius</hi> also, together with <hi>Marcellus</hi> and <hi>Asclepas</hi> his Fellow-sufferers, publickly challeng'd them to it, assuring the Synod they would not only refute their Slanders and Calumnies, but make it fully appear what Mischiefs and Miseries they had brought upon their several Churches. <hi>Protogenes</hi> Bishop of <hi>Sardica,</hi> and <hi>Hosius</hi> the aged Confessor, and venerable Bishop of <hi>Corduba,</hi> and now President of the Council, address'd themselves to them in a more private way, endeavouring by all fair means to perswade them, <hi>Hosius</hi>

An offer so infinitely reasonable, and fair beyond all Expectation, that nothing but obstinacy and a bad Cause could have the face to refuse it. However, they resolv'd not to appear upon any Terms, nor submit to a Sentence, which they had too much reason to suspect would go full against them.</p>

                        </note> in the first place, that <hi>Athanasius</hi> and his Accomplices had been heretofore convicted of notorious Crimes, and accordingly condemn'd and depos'd by several Councils, and that they could not joyn with the Synod, till they were banish'd thence, and denied Communion; otherwise they should trample under foot the Laws of the Church, rescind and violate the Sentence of God. But the Synod was satisfied in this Matter, their Cause having been more than once maturely debated, and their Innocency adjudg'd in Councils call'd for that purpose, and themselves absolv'd, and receiv'd to Communion by almost all the Bishops of the <hi>West.</hi> Next they pleaded that vast numbers of Persons, guilty of the most enormous Villanies, of Blood and Murders, of Rapine and Violence, of Sacriledge and Impiety, and what not? both against God and Man, had at this time flock'd hither from <hi>Constantinople</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and were entertain'd and encourag'd, advanc'd and respected by the Synod, with whom they could not communicate without manifest Impiety and Prophanation. And whereas <hi>Athanasius</hi> his Innocency was so much insisted on, they made this offer, that a select number of each Party might be sent into <hi>Egypt,</hi> to the places where the Crimes charg'd upon him, had been committed, and might be bound under the Obligation of an Oath, to take a faithful account of things; that if the Charge prov'd false, they were ready to submit to censure, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising never to exhibit any Complaints, either to the Emperors, or to any Synod or Bishop; but if true, that the other Party should silently acquiesce in what had been already done. This Proposal was made by those five Commissioners, who had been, many years since, deputed by the Council of <hi>Tyre,</hi> to go into <hi>Maraeotis</hi> to examine and report the State of things; and they now renew'd the same Motion probably, either to gain time, not knowing but some emergent acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent might intervene, or because they knew they should be able there successfully to manage the Cause to their own Advantage, as they had already done heretofore. But the Synod rejected the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, having<note n="u" place="margin">Epist. Syn. ap. Athan. Apol. <hi>II.</hi> p. <hi>593.</hi> &amp; ad Solit. p. <hi>634.</hi>

                        </note> to attest the Truth of things. Being thus beaten out of all other Refuges, they fell upon one more absurd and weak than all the rest, pretending<note n="x" place="margin">Ath. ad Sol. ubi supr.</note> that they had receiv'd Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from the Emperor concerning his triumphant Victories against the <hi>Persians,</hi> and that there was a necessity of their departure to assist at those Solemnities. This they intimated to the Synod by <hi>Eusta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thius</hi> Presbyter of the Church of <hi>Sardica,</hi> to whom <hi>Hosius</hi> in the name of the rest, sent back this short peremptory Message, that either they should stand to, and make good the Charge which they had exhibited, and answer that which others had given in against them, or they might assure themselves, that the Synod would take the Matter <hi>pro Confesso,</hi> and proceed against them as Criminals, and acquit <hi>Athanasius</hi> and his Party. A Message which serv'd only to quicken their departure thence.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. SOME time it was, that they had now staid at <hi>Sardica,</hi> which we cannot suppose they spent meerly in Wrangling and Contention. No, they held frequent Assemblies, and though in a private and clandestine way, kept up the Formalities of a Synod. They plainly
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:49523:119"/> saw what measure they were like to expect from the Council, and therefore resolv'd not to be behind-hand with them. Hereupon they Synodically proceeded against the Heads of the Party, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning<note n="y" place="margin">Soz. l. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>11.</hi> p. <hi>512.</hi>

                        <note n="z" place="margin">Ad Ann. <hi>347.</hi> Num. <hi>LXX.</hi>
                        </note> is out of all Patience. What! excommunicate the Head of the Church? Depose the Prince of the Apostolick See? A piece of Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, he tells us, never before attempted in any Age by the most execrable Heresie. But the Priviledge of the infallible Chair, was not, it seems, then understood, nor these bold men frighted with the noise of, <hi>Thou art Peter.</hi> Next they drew up a Confession of Faith, wherein they particularly condemn some of the <hi>Arian</hi> Propositions; a Confession wherein the most Critical of the Catholicks found no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to complain of, but that the word <hi>Consubstantial</hi> was left out; and accordingly it was own'd by S. <hi>Hillary</hi>

                        </note>, and is expounded by him into a very Orthodox sence. This done, they wrote a very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix <hi>Encyclical</hi> Epistle<note n="b" place="margin">Ext. ap. Hilar. in fragm. col. <hi>434.</hi>
                        </note>, which they publish'd in the name of the <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dican</hi> Synod, wherein they give an account of what they had done, and of the Bishops whom they had depos'd, whom they expose with all contempt imaginable, and load with the bitterest Reflections they could heap upon them, charging the Governours of the Church, as they valued Peace, Order, and Ecclesiastick Discipline, to abstain from all Communion with them, either by word or writing, not to send Letters to them, or receive any from them, or so much as have to do with any that did communicate with them, subjoyning to the Epistle, the Confession of their Faith. This decretal Letter they dispatch'd abroad to the Bishops of several Countries, and amongst the rest, to <hi>Donatus</hi> the Head of that schismatical Faction at <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi> hoping that the <hi>Donatists</hi> who stood at such open defiance to the Catholicks, might by this means be brought over to their Party. And indeed we find the <hi>Donatists</hi> glorying in their Communion with the <hi>Eastern</hi> Bishops, and insisting upon this Epistle of the <hi>Sardican</hi> Synod, (for as such it pass'd) as the evidence of it; and the truth is, it seems, that for some time after, no other <hi>Sardican</hi> Synod was known in <hi>Africk,</hi> but this clancular Convention, which may seem the stranger, in that <hi>Gratus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Carthage</hi> was at this time a Member of the Council.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. THAT all this was done by the <hi>Eastern</hi> Prelates, during their stay at <hi>Sardica,</hi> I am strongly tempted to believe. I know the report passes currant, uncontradicted, that I know of, by any writer, that in their return from <hi>Sardica,</hi> they staid at <hi>Philippopolis,</hi> a City of <hi>Thrace,</hi> where they held a Synod, and pass'd the things we have but now mention'd, which, that they might be swallowed more unsuspected, they gilded over with the specious title of the <hi>Sardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> Synod. Now though I love not needlesly to swim against the Stream, yet I must profess I see no reason to fix the Scene at <hi>Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>popolis.</hi>
                        <pb n="114" facs="tcp:49523:120"/>
'Tis founded upon the single Authority of <hi>Socrates</hi>

                           <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 20. <hi>p.</hi> 102.</note>, not mention'd by any Writer (that I know of) after him, ancienter than the two trifling anonymous Authors in <hi>Photius,</hi> who write with little certainty, and less judgment. Sure I am, 'tis not so much as once hinted by <hi>Athanasius,</hi> then whom none more exact in setting down these Affairs, nor in any of the Letters which the Synod wrote, wherein they give a most particular account of things; it being equally improbable that they should not know it, and if known, that they should omit it. Besides, the <hi>Eastern</hi> Bishops do not only in the front of their Epistle affirm, that they celebrated their Council in the City of <hi>Sardica,</hi> but in the body of it expresly say, that they did <hi>de Sardica scribere</hi>

                        </note>, write the account they there give from <hi>Sardica.</hi> And with what confidence can we imagine men of common Prudence should in a publick Epistle tell the World, that these things were done at <hi>Sardica,</hi> had it been notoriously known (as it must be, had it been so) that they were dispatch'd at a place an hundred Miles distant from it? That which perhaps led <hi>Socrates</hi> into the mistake, was this. The <hi>Eastern</hi> Bishops in their Journey to <hi>Sardica</hi>
                        <note n="e" place="margin">Epist. Syn. ap. Athan. Apol. <hi>II.</hi> p. <hi>595.</hi>
                        </note> held many little Synods of their own Party by the way in several Places, (and no doubt at <hi>Philippopolis</hi> amongst the rest) where it was agreed amongst them (and those who seem'd backward, were threatned into compliance) that when they came thither, they should perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily refuse to concur with the Synod, or to put the Affair to the issue of a Trial, but that having appear'd for fashion-sake, should break up and depart. And thus indeed <hi>Sozomen</hi>
                        <note n="f" place="margin">
                           <hi>Lib</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 11. <hi>p.</hi> 411.</note> plainly reports it, that before they came to <hi>Sardica,</hi> meeting first at <hi>Philippopolis,</hi> they thence wrote to the <hi>Western</hi> Bishops at <hi>Sardica,</hi> to let them know, that unless they dismiss'd <hi>Athanasius</hi> and his Party, and abstain'd from their Communion, as Persons already sentenc'd and depos'd, they would in no wise joyn with them; and they were as good as their word, when they arriv'd at <hi>Sardica;</hi> where after several Transacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to no purpose, but rather to the exasperating of each into a wider distance, they met (as he tells us) in separate Assemblies, and made Decrees contrary to each other; and then immediately subjoyns what they did in the deposing of the Bishops, we mention'd, and in the Explication of their Faith, and the circular Epistle which they wrote upon it; which is a just Representation of things in their due place and order. All which <hi>Socrates</hi> not carefully attending to, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds what was done at <hi>Sardica,</hi> with what pass'd before at <hi>Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>popolis,</hi> making that the Scene of their Synodical Transactions, which had been only the Seat of their preparatory Councils. Nor is it the only instance wherein he mistakes, not only in other Cases, but in this very Affair of the <hi>Sardican</hi> Council, as were it worth the while, I could evidently make appear.</p>
                     <p n="7">VII.

                        </note> us, there were that lay before them, and which the Emperors by their Letters had left to them to be freely discuss'd and ventilated in the Council, the soundness of the Faith, the Case of the Persons accus'd and condemn'd, and an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into the great Evils and Mischiefs which the <hi>Arian</hi> Party were reported to have committed in every place. As to the first, however
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:49523:120"/> Matters of Faith might be debated in the Synod, 'tis certain they made no Synodical Determination in that Matter. Indeed to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretal Epistle of the Council, as 'tis extant in <hi>Theodorit</hi>
                        <note n="h" place="margin">Lib. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>8.</hi> p. <hi>80.</hi> &amp;c.</note>, there is an <hi>Appendix</hi> containing a large account and Explication of their Faith. And it was it seems an early Addition; for <hi>Athanasius</hi>
                        <note n="i" place="margin">Epist. ad An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch. p. <hi>449.</hi>
                        </note> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self takes notice of it, and cautions against it, and withall assures us, that the Council defin'd no such Matter. He sayes, indeed, that some men were very hot that a Supplement might be made to the Faith agreed on in the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> but that the Synod vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently rejected the Motion, and decreed that nothing should be farther added to the Faith, declaring that they fully acquiesced in the <hi>Nicen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

Accordingly in all ancient Copies both in <hi>Athanasius</hi> and S. <hi>Hilary</hi> this additional Appendage is left out, and it argued either in-sincerity, or at least great carelesness in <hi>Theodorit</hi> to insert it. 'Tis mention'd also by <hi>Sozomen</hi>

                     <p n="8">VIII. THE Persons accus'd, and who were now present that their Cause might be heard and canvas'd in the Synod, were <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius</hi> of <hi>Alexandria, Marcellus</hi> of <hi>Ancyra,</hi> and <hi>Asclepas</hi> of <hi>Gaza,</hi> who petition'd the Synod that their Accusers might be summon'd to appear, which the Accusers obstinately refusing (though particularly challeng'd to't by the Defendants more than once) the Fathers proceeded to take cognizance of their several Cases.

                        </note> upon that Emperor's easie and credulous Temper, that he gave them leave to proceed against the Catholick Party, which they did with all imaginable Force and Cruelty, especially against the Bishops and Clergy. Some they loaded with the heaviest Calumnies, others they banish'd, others they put to death, as at <hi>Adrianople,</hi> where, with the assistance of their old trusty Friend Count <hi>Philagrius,</hi> they beheaded many, (the Monuments of which savage Inhumanity, <hi>Athanasius</hi> tells us, he himself saw without the City at his return) and when <hi>Lucius</hi> the Bishop reprov'd their impious Practices, they bound him neck and hands with Chains, and sent him into Exile, where he died. Edicts they procur'd from the Emperor for the casting them out of all Cities and Churches, and putting them to death where-ever they should be found, and that all Ports and Gates should be strictly watch'd, that if any of the Bishops restor'd by the Synod, should return to their Bishopricks, they might be immediately apprehended; and having the advantage of the publick Posts, Messengers were dispatch'd into all Parts, and where they met with any that dis-allowed their Proceedings, they either scourg'd them like Slaves, or imprison'd, or banish'd them. And for <hi>Athanasius</hi> and his faithful Clergy, Edicts were particularly directed to the Governors of that City, that if any of them came thither, or did but set their foot within the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, they should be forthwith put to death.

For the <hi>Arian</hi> Faction had so block'd up all Passages, that there was little hope their Embassy should succeed. Nay, not content to ruine them by publick and open Violence, they endeavoured by secret and hellish Arts to blast and smother the Reputation of these venerable Bishops at their first Arrival. For which end a Plot<note n="x" place="margin">Ath. ib. p. <hi>636, 637.</hi> Theod. ubi Supr. c. <hi>9.</hi> p. <hi>84.</hi>
                        </note> is set on foot, contrived by <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi> Bishop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and carried on by him and his Clergy, and such lend Persons as they had drawn into the Conspiracy, which in short was thus. An infamous Strumpet was by night introduc'd into the Bishop's Lodgings by one <hi>Onager,</hi> a Fellow of a most debauch'd and flagitious Life, he himself with fifteen of his Associates being near at hand to assist and carry on the Plot. And to mend the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it was the time of <hi>Easter,</hi> when this Scene was laid. Some of the Family being before-hand corrupted, the Woman is let in, and having stript her self, went directly to the apartment where the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:49523:123"/> Bishops lodg'd. The first she entred was that of <hi>Euphratas,</hi> the elder Bishop of the two, whom she found asleep; but awaking with the noise, and finding by her voice that it was a Woman, he began to cry out in a great amazement, supposing it to be some <hi>Daemon</hi> that had assum'd a Female shape. The Woman (who had been made to believe, that a young Gentleman newly come to Town had desired her company that night) perceiving that 'twas a grave ancient Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, was as much surpriz'd on the other side, and presently shriek'd and cryed out aloud, nor could all that <hi>Onager</hi> and his Party could say, still her clamour, and perswade her to go on with the Design. In short, the Family is rais'd, the Woman and seven of the Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators are taken, and secur'd till next Morning, when (the whole City flocking at the rumor of so strange a Passage) the Matter is heard and examin'd before the Emperor in the Pallace, where it is quickly brought to light, the Woman confessing who 'twas that had set her on, and he impeaching <hi>Onager</hi> as the Person that had acted him, and <hi>Onager</hi> casting the original Contrivance of all upon <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi> the Bishop. The issue was, that the Bishops then at Court, were commanded by the Emperor and the Judges to depose <hi>Stephen,</hi> and place another in his room. Which was immediately done: so signally did his malicious and diabolical Project return upon his own head.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. HOW powerfully does the divine Providence many times over-rule the attempts of bad men, to an end quite contrary to their Designs and Expectations! This unfortunate enterprize not only fail'd in the main Intention, but a little awakned the mind of <hi>Constantius,</hi> and made him suspect that Cause could not be very good, that need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed such impious Artifices to support it. Hereupon he began to relax the severity that had been us'd, commanded the Deacons and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that had been banish'd into <hi>Armenia,</hi> to return, and wrote ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly to <hi>Alexandria</hi> to stop all Proceedings against <hi>Athanasius</hi> and his Party. Indeed there had pass'd of late several dispatches between him and his Brother <hi>Constans</hi> about this Matter, in one<note n="y" place="margin">Ext. ap.

                        </note> whereof (as we noted before) <hi>Constans</hi> plainly told him, that unless <hi>Athanasius</hi> were suddenly restored, and his Enemies call'd to an account, he himself would come in Person, and re-settle him by force of Arms. This smart Message, together with what accidents had since ensued, turn'd the Scale with him, who calling some of his Bishops toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, communicated to them his thoughts about these Matters, and especially about the rupture that was like to ensue between him and his Brother. Their Advice was, that the least of Evils was to be chosen, and that it were better <hi>Athanasius</hi> should be restored to his See, than the State of the Empire put to the hazards of a Civil War. And the Council at this time was very wise and prudent, <hi>Constantius</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing engag'd in a tedious and not very successful War against the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> an Enemy big enough alone to employ the whole Strength of the <hi>Eastern</hi> Empire.

And so far were even some young men and women transported, as upon this occasion to dedicate themselves to a stricter course of Piety: Alms and Charity were distributed with a liberal hand, the hungry were fed, the naked cloath'd, Widows and Orphans provided for; the great Contention was, who should express most forwardness in acts of Piety and Vertue, so that every Family seem'd to be turn'd into a little Church.

An Address therefore is made to him with Letters<note n="h" place="margin">Epist. Lib. ad Const. Conc. T. <hi>11</hi> col. <hi>745.</hi>
                        </note> containing the Crimes that were charg'd upon <hi>Athanasius.

And the thing, I confess, is not improbable, it being evident that <hi>Liberius</hi> for several years after his entrance upon that See, stood firm to <hi>Athanasius</hi> and the Catholick Cause, nor could be drawn to subscribe to his Deposition, by all the Arts the Emperor

They put him in mind of the day of Judgment, and advis'd him not to offer violence to the Church, not to blend the civil Power with Ecclesiastick Constitutions, nor to introduce <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anism</hi> into the Church of God. His anger and impatience could bear no more, but full of rage and threatning, he brandish'd his Sword at them, and forth with commanded several of them to be banish'd, <hi>Eusebius</hi> of <hi>Vercelles</hi> to <hi>Schythopolis, Lucifer Cataritanus</hi> into <hi>Palaestine,</hi> where he wrote against the Emperor, <hi>Dionysius</hi> of <hi>Milan</hi> into <hi>Cappa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docia,</hi> where he died, and <hi>Paulinus</hi> of <hi>Triers,</hi> who in the fifth year of his banishment died in <hi>Phrygia.</hi>

But the Bishop rejected them with a generous scorn, and told him, that he could not consent to condemn <hi>Athanasius,</hi> a Person, who had been once and again Synodically absolv'd from all the Crimes charg'd upon him, and whom the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had entertain'd and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss'd with peace; that it would look strange, if he should reject him being absent, with whom when present he had maintain'd friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and agreement, and that this was not the Canon nor Custom of the Church; that if the Emperor was concern'd for the Peace of the Church, and desirous that what had been written in defence of <hi>Athanasius</hi> might be raz'd and stifled, it was but fit that what had
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:49523:130"/> been written against him should be blotted out also, and such a Synod call'd, where neither the Emperor might be present, nor any of his great Ministers of State to influence and awe the Council; where nothing but the fear of God, and the Apostolick Constitution might take place, that so the Faith agreed upon at <hi>Nice</hi> might be first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, and the Favourers of <hi>Arianism</hi> condemn'd, and that then the Case of <hi>Athanasius</hi> and his Opposers might be discuss'd and canvass'd. This had been the way of the Ancients, and with this Resolution he might acquaint the Emperor. The Eunuch was vex'd to find the Bishop not only unwilling to subscribe, but obstinately infected with what he call'd Heresie, whereupon he broke out into high words and threatnings, and taking up the Presents, went out of doors, and entring into S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church, offer'd them at the Altar. Which <hi>Liberius</hi> no sooner understood, but he sharply chid the Guardian of the Church for suffering it, and threw the Gifts that had been offer'd out of doors. Which still more exasperated the Eunuch, who made no over-favourable Representation of these things to the Emperor.

                        <hi>CONSTANTIƲS.</hi> Forasmuch as you are a Christian, and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of our City, we have thought good to send for you, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish you to renounce Communion with the leud and wretched Cause of <hi>Athanasius.</hi> A thing wherein the World has consented, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by Synodal Sentence banish'd him all Ecclesiastical Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. <hi>LIBERIƲS.</hi> Sir, I the Determination of Ecclesiastick Affairs, ought to be made with all possible Equity and Impartiality. If therefore it please your Majesty, let the Cause be judg'd; and if it shall appear that <hi>Athanasius</hi> deserves to be condemn'd, then according to the Rules of Ecclesiastical Proceedings, let Sentence pass against
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:49523:130"/> him; for we cannot condemn a Person, whom we have not judged. <hi>CONST.</hi> The whole World has already pass'd Sentence upon his impious Cause, but he, as he has done all along, does but trifle away the time, and make light of it. <hi>LIB.</hi> They who gave this account, did not themselves see the things done, but wrote them for vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory, or fear, or to avoid the disgrace which your Majesty might cast upon them. <hi>CONST.</hi> What glory, what fear, what disgrace do you mean? <hi>LIB.</hi> Those I mean, who do not love the Glory of God, but preferring your bounty and favour, have condemn'd him, whom they have neither seen nor judg'd. A thing which all true Christians do abhor. <hi>CONST.</hi> Was he not present in the Synod at <hi>Tyre,</hi> and there judg'd and condemn'd by all the Prelates of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire? <hi>LIB.</hi> No, Sir, he was never judg'd where himself was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; for they who condemn'd him in that Assembly, pass'd that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just Sentence upon him after his departure from the Council. <hi>EƲ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SEBIƲS.</hi> [In the Synod of <hi>Nice</hi>

Of these five two are dead, <hi>Theognis</hi> and <hi>Theodorus,</hi> the three others, <hi>Maris, Valens</hi> and <hi>Ʋrsacius,</hi> are still alive; who for this very Cause were condemn'd in the <hi>Sardican</hi> Synod, and who afterwards in a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod prefer'd their Libels, and beg'd pardon for the Acts which in <hi>Maraetis</hi> they had falsely and clandestinely fram'd against <hi>Athanasius;</hi> which Libels we have now by us. And now, Sir, Judge, whom we ought rather to believe, and communicate with? those who first condemn'd <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and then ask'd pardon for what they had done, or those who lately condemn'd them for such irregular Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? <hi>EPICTETƲS.</hi> It is not, Sir, for the Faiths-sake, or for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Ecelesiastical Judgments, that <hi>Liberius</hi> at this time makes all this stir, but that he may boast to the Senators at <hi>Rome,</hi> that he has been too hard for the Emperor. <hi>CONST.</hi> How considerable a part of the World, <hi>Liberius,</hi> do you reckon your self, that you only should patronize a vile man, and thereby disturb the Peace of the whole <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire? <hi>LIB.</hi> Though I were alone in this Matter, yet the Cause of the Faith would not be thereby prejudic'd. There was once a time, when there were but three found that refus'd to comply with the King's Command. <hi>EƲSEB.</hi> What, then you make our Emperor a second <hi>Nebuchadnezzar. LIB.</hi> No, I do not; but you rashly condemn a Person, whom we have not judg'd. All that I require is, that first the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed may be ratified by an universal Subscription; then, that our Brethren that are banish'd may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call'd, and restor'd to their Sees; and if then it appear, that they who now rais'd all there stirs, do embrace the Apostolick Faith, we may all Synodically meet at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> where both the Accusers and the Accused are, and the Advocates of each Party, where having throughly examin'd Matters, we may unanimously pronounce Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in the Case. <hi>EPICT.</hi> But the publick Carriages will not suffice to convey so many Bishops thither. <hi>LIB.</hi> As for that, Ecclesiastical Causes need not the assistance of the publick Carriages. For every Church may easily enough at their own Charge transport their Bishops by Sea. <hi>CONST.</hi> The things that have been already
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:49523:131"/> agreed on, cannot be undone; for the Vote of the Majority of Bishops ought to prevail. You are the only Person that retains the Friendship of that wicked man. <hi>LIB.</hi> Sir, I never yet heard a Judge lay Impiety to any Person's Charge, who was not there to answer for himself; a thing that would rather argue a private Grudge and Enmity against him. <hi>CONST.</hi> He has in general in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd all men, but no man like me. For not content with the death of my elder Brother, he never ceas'd to stir up <hi>Constans</hi> of blessed Memory to Quarrels and Hostility against me, which must have broken out into ill Effects; if I by a most invincible Meekness and Patience had not born the powerful Inclination both of him that was excited, and of him that excited him to that attempt. And therefore I account no Victory so great, no not that which I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd over <hi>Magnentius</hi> and <hi>Silvanus,</hi> as I do the ejecting this wretched man out of all Ecclesiastick Administration. <hi>LIB.</hi> I beseech you, Sir, don't reek your Enmity upon the Bishops; for the hands of Ecclesiasticks ought to be imploy'd only to bless and consecrate. May it please you therefore to command that the Bishops be recall'd to their own Sees, and if they than be found to agree with him, who to this hour tenaciously adheres to the orthodox Faith explain'el in the Synod of <hi>Nice,</hi> then let them assemble and provide for the Peace of the World, that so it may not appear that an Innocent man is branded and condemn'd. <hi>CONST.</hi> All that I require and command is, that you entertain Communion with the Churches, and return back to <hi>Rome.</hi> Yield therefore to Peace, and subscribe, and then go home. <hi>LIB.</hi> I have already taken leave of the Brethren at <hi>Rome;</hi> for the Laws of the Church are dearer to me, than an Habitation at <hi>Rome. CONST.</hi> I give you three dayes time to advise, whether you will subscribe and go back to <hi>Rome,</hi> or to consider of what other place you desire to be transported to. <hi>LIB.</hi> It is not the space of three dayes or months, that will make any Alteration in my mind. Send me therefore whither you please.</p>

The Empress also sent him the like Sum, which he return'd with the like answer, adding, that if the Emperor had no need of the Money to pay his Army, he might give them to <hi>Auxentius</hi> and <hi>Epictetus</hi> (two <hi>Arian</hi> Bishops that hung about the Court) who had need enough of them. When <hi>Eusebius</hi> the Eunuch perceiv'd that he had refused the imperial Presents, he himself brought him one.

By this time the Souldiers were advanc'd, and were coming to beset the Quire, when the Clergy and People that were about him, earnestly besought <hi>Athanasius</hi> to shift for himself, he on the other hand protesting he would not stir a foot, till they were all departed, and rising from his Chair, passionately intreated them to be gone, affirming it to be much better, that he

All things were full of Terror and Confusion, the Church prophan'd with blood and dead Carcasses, with Swords and Arms, no reverence had either to Persons or Things, the Souldiers rushing into those places, where none but the holy Order were permitted to enter, and when any complain'd, or pray'd help of <hi>Syrianus</hi> against force and violence, they were rejected and soundly beaten into the bargain: Nay, he endeavoured to force the People to an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment, that no Tumult had been rais'd, nor any hurt done.

Many young Maids they forcibly took out of their Father's Houses; others they abus'd and affronted as they met them in the Streets, stirring up the wild Rabble to pull off their Vales, and giving their own Wives leave to abuse all they met, so that grave Matrons were glad, as they met them, to step aside, and give them the way; who ran up and down like wild Furies, accounting it a hard Case, and a lost day, wherein they had not done some injury or mischief. Nor did the Clergy fare better than the rest, the Deacons and Presbyters, yea and their Friends and Followers were pull'd out, banish'd, beaten, and some kill'd and by a Savage Barbarity not commonly known amongst men, their dead Bodies torn limb from limb. So that all Humanity seem'd to be laid aside, and Hell it self to be broken loose. They took <hi>Eutychius</hi> a Sub-deacon, a man of approved Integrity and Fidelity, and having whip'd him, till they had even driven his Soul out of his Body, were carrying him to the Mines, and the worst part of them too, call'd <hi>Pheno,</hi> a place where the sturdiest Malefactor is not wont to live many dayes, not giving him so much as an hours respite for the dressing and curing of his Wounds. But the good man was soon releas'd out of their hands, for they had not gone far, when unable to hold out, he dropt down and died. The People out of common Compassion had interceded for him, but were rejected, and four of them, honest and substantial men, were apprehended for their pains, grievously scourg'd and thrown into Prison. And when the <hi>Arians</hi> not satisfied herewith, murmured, and threatned to complain above, the Commander, out of fear, gave order that they should be scourg'd a second time, the Innocent men saying no more, than that, <q>'Tis for the Truth that we suffer, we cannot communicate with Hereticks; go on to beat us as much as you please, there will be a time when God will reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on with you for these things.</q> And that they might wholly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish all sparks of Charity and Compassion, they suffer'd not the Poor to be reliev'd; for whereas the poor Widows and Orphans that had formerly been sustain'd by the Bounty of the Church, were yet provided for by the kindness of pious and charitable Persons, they now by a new and unheard of Cruelty indicted, prosecuted and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd those who receiv'd the Alms, as well as those that gave them.

NOR did their rage extend only to the living, but even to senceless and inanimate things; they took the Benches in the Church, the Episcopal Chair, the Communion-Table, the Partitions, and whatever else they could bring away, and throwing them on an heap in the great Street before the Church-gate, set them on fire, casting Frankincense into it. A day of Triumph, of Joy and Jubilee to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who concluded, that surely the Emperor and the <hi>Arians</hi> were coming over to them, and were so far elevated in their Hopes and Expectations, that they were upon the Point publickly to set up their <hi>Pagan</hi>-Rites; for espying a Beast drawing Water for the Gardens of the imperial Palace, they intended it for a Sacrifice, and had actually done it, but that it prov'd an Heifer, which was not allow'd by their Sacrificial Laws. And certainly had they not been fatally bent upon these mischievons Proceedings, they met with some unhappy Accidents, that one would have thought should have stop'd their Career. When they first broke into the Church, a bold young Fellow rush'd into the Quire, and insolently clapping himself down in the Bishop's Throne, sung a leud obscene Song through the Nose, and rising up, caught the Chair, with an intent to beat it all in pieces, when a large Splinter of it ran into his Belly, and pierc'd his Bowels, which presently began to flow out, and being taken up, and carried away, he died the next day. Another coming into the Church with boughs in his hands, and waving them about after the Gentile manner, was immediately struck stark blind, and became insensible where he was, and being ready to drop down, was carried out, and after a dayes time hardly recovered his understanding, being neither sensible of what he had done, nor of what had been done to him. These miraculous Interposals of the divine Providence, though they had no good effect upon the <hi>Arians,</hi> who <hi>Pharoh</hi>-like were hardned the more by every stroke, yet struck terror into the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who become less forward to such prophane attempts. And indeed to such a height did the Cruelties of this Persecution proceed, that the very <hi>Gentiles</hi> began to be asham'd on't, and could not but abominate the <hi>Arians</hi> as the most merciless inhumane Butchers, Persons that offered notorious Violence to all those Principles of kindness and tenderness, that are natural and essential to Mankind.</p>

WHILE the Storm fell thus heavy round about, God had provided <hi>Athanasius</hi> a secure shelter in the Wilderness, where in the midst of his solitary Retirements he enjoy'd the pleasures of a very grateful Conversation, the company of those pious and devout Inhabitants of the Desert, the primitive Monks, a quite other sort of men from those who in these latter Ages pass under that name and Character; Persons who retiring from the World, lived wholly to God, and were intirely taken up in the most severe Exercises of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, a Course wherein they had been trained up by <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Thebais,</hi> and <hi>Athanasius</hi>'s kind Friend S. <hi>Anthony</hi> (who was still alive) the two great Founders of the Monastick Institution. There were two<note n="e" place="margin">Naz. Orat. <hi>XXI.</hi> p. <hi>384.</hi>
                        </note> sorts of them, <hi>Eremitae</hi> and <hi>Coenobitae;</hi> the first were wholly devoted to So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, and convers'd with none but God and themselves, and knew no more of the World, than what they met with in the Wilderness; the other kept together in Societies, exercising mutual Love and Fellowship, and were <hi>Hermits</hi> in the midst of populous Cities, and led mortified lives amidst the noise and crowd, being a World to themselves, and by mutual Conversation great examples and incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to Piety and Vertue. With these our great man spent his time, reconciling in his own Practice both the Solitary and the Coenobitick Life, shewing that the Episcopal Order could Philosophize, and that Philosophy it self needed Episcopal Direction; both the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and the active Life met in him, and he convinc'd the World, that a Monastick Life consisted more in Gravity and Constancy of Manners, than in an absolute Separation from the World. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed with so great Reverence and Veneration did they entertain him, that whatever he commanded or dislik'd, was receiv'd by them as a Law; and when afterwards he was hunted as a Partridge upon the Mountains, they not only refus'd to tell the Messengers where he was, but so much as to speak to them, exposing their Necks to drawn Swords for his sake, and accounting it a more sublime and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick Action to suffer for him, than to refine themselves by long fasting and abstinence, and other Religious Austerities, which yet they accounted the Pleasure as well as Duty of that place. To gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the desires of these devout Companions, and to do right to Truth, he wrote that large Epistle <gap reason="foreign">

And because his Adversaries heavily charg'd upon him his retirement, as an evidence of his Guilt, and the badness of his Cause, he wrote an <hi>Apology for his Flight,</hi> wherein he shews what cause they had given him so to do, and that his withdrawing was warranted by the Will
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:49523:136"/> of God, the reason of things, and the Examples of wise and good men in all Ages. This he back'd with an <hi>Apology to the Emperor,</hi> wherein he very particularly answers at large to all the material Crimes that had been charg'd upon him, assuring his Majesty that he was most ready and desirous personally to have done it in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and had begun his Journey, when the evil Tidings, that like <hi>Job</hi>'s Messengers came flocking in, one still worse than another, made him retreat, and look upon the attempt as desperate. Some time after he wrote a <hi>Second Apology</hi> for himself, wherein he justifies his Innocency from the publick Attestations and Decrees of several Synods that had been purposely held to that end in <hi>Egypt,</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> at <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dica,</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and by the Testimony both of the Emperor <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stans,</hi> and <hi>Constantius,</hi> all which he demonstrates out of publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, and the Epistles themselves, which he there inserts.</p>

BUT the most unspotted Innocency is not shield enough against the Assaults of Envy, nor can Rocks and Mountains afford a Refuge and Protection, where Cruelty is inspir'd by an active Malice.

She bad him welcome, performing her self the meanest Offices to him, and there he remain'd unknown to any for six years together, till the Death of <hi>Constantius</hi> let him out; when to the astonishment of all, he was unexpectedly found sitting in the Church. These Passages I have related, not that I give any credit to them, or advise the Reader to believe them, but because de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by Writers, who themselves liv'd in, or near those times, nay <hi>Palladius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Helenopolis</hi> (the first Reporter that I find of the Story) assures us, that he was acquainted with this very Virgin, then seventy years of Age, when he was at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and that the whole Clergy of the Church attested the Truth of her Relation. <hi>Baronius</hi>

This was the sum of their Declaration, whereto they design'd to gain the Subscriptions of some of the most eminent of the Catholick Party; and first they set upon <hi>Hosius,</hi> a man of renown, whom they partly insnar'd, and partly compell'd into a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with them.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. THIS venerable Prelate was Bishop of <hi>Corduba</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> in which capacity he appeared, and subscribed in the eleventh place in the <hi>Illiberin</hi> Council, held about the year CCCV. He had been a noble Confessor even under the Heathen Persecutions, a Person of singular account, and who had for many years been imploy'd in the most important Affairs and Transactions of the Church. He was peculiarly dear to <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, who committed to his care the adjusting the Difference between <hi>Caecilian</hi> and <hi>Donatus</hi> of <hi>Carthage</hi> in the <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Arles, Ann.</hi> CCCXIV. and sent him afterwards to <hi>Alexandria</hi> to compose the growing Differences between <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Arius;</hi> present soon after in the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> where he bore a prime stroke, and had a chief hand in drawing up the Creed; call'd also to that of <hi>Sardica,</hi> where he was President of the Council, and stoutly defended the <hi>Athanasian</hi> Cause. Indeed a man of that great Reverence and Authority, that he was at every turn styl'd <hi>Father Hosius,</hi> counted and call'd the Father of Bishops. The <hi>Arians</hi> knew well of what importance it would be to them, to have so considerable a Person brought over to their Party, or at least sent out of the way, and therefore addressing themselves to <hi>Constantius,</hi> represented<note n="n" place="margin">Ath. ad Solit. p. <hi>648.</hi>
                        </note> to him, that they had taken all courses that they could for the support and advancement of their Cause, that they had banish'd <hi>Liberius,</hi> and many other Bishops before him, and had fill'd all places with Terror and Violence, but that all this turn'd to no account, so long as <hi>Hosius</hi> was left in the way, that so long as he stood his ground, all others in a manner possess'd their Churches, being a Person of that eminent Ability and Authority, that he alone was able to arm the whole World against them; that 'twas he that steer'd Synods, and whose Letters were receiv'd every where with an uncontroulable
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:49523:138"/> Veneration, that 'twas he that bad compos'd the <hi>Nicene</hi> Faith, and every where proclaim'd the <hi>Arians</hi> to be Hereticks; that therefore his Majesty should do well to set upon him also, without any regard to his Gray Hairs, a nicety which their Cause did not stick at. The Emperor easily perswaded by their Insinuations, sent for him, and as he had before done to <hi>Liberius,</hi> sought by fair and plausible Councils and Arguments to perswade him to subscribe, and joyn with the <hi>Arians.</hi> The good old man was infinitely surpriz'd, and troubled to hear the least motion made that way, for which he check'd the Emperor, and at length prevail'd with him to desist, who accordingly gave him leave to return back into his own Country. But his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies did not leave him so, but again sollicited the Emperor, and by help of their Friends the Eunuchs at Court, so exasperated his mind, that he wrote him a sharp Letter full of Menaces and Reproaches, which yet wrought as little upon him, as Promises and Perswasives had done before. This Letter was followed by several others, the Emperor sometimes insinuating, and gently treating him as a Father, sometimes threatning, and laying before him those that had been banish'd, letting him know how ill he took it, that he only should stand out. To which <hi>Hosius</hi> return'd an Answer<note n="o" place="margin">Tixt. Epist. ib. p. <hi>649.</hi>
                        </note> to this effect, that he had been a Confessor under the <hi>Maximian</hi> Persecution, and was ready to be so again, rather than to betray the Truth; that he might hearken to him that was old enough to be his Grand-father; that he had been present at, and privy to all the Transactions of the <hi>Sardican</hi> Council, where he had seen <hi>Athanasius</hi> openly challenge his Adversaries, who retir'd with shame; that like his Brother <hi>Constans,</hi> he should lay aside force and terror, and suffer things to come to a fair and impartial Trial; that he should remember that he himself was Mortal, and ought to live under the awful sence of a Judgment to come, and reserve himself undefiled against that day, and not thrust himself upon the Determination of Ecclesiastick Matters; that for the Case in hand, his Resolution was this, that he would not joyn with the <hi>Arians,</hi> but would condemn their Heresie; nor would he sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe against <hi>Athanasius,</hi> whom he and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and a whole Synod had pronounced Innocent, and to which his Majesty himself had assented, having thereupon honourably remitted him to his own See: concluding thus, <hi>Stop, I beseech you, Sir, and be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded by me, for these are things which both become me to write, and you not to despise.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">III. THIS resolute Letter did but the more provoke the Party, who told the Emperor, that <hi>Hosius</hi> reflected upon him as a Persecutor, and was so far from complying with his Majesties desires, that for <hi>Athanasius</hi>'s sake he condemn'd the <hi>Arians,</hi> and perswaded others to suffer death, rather than betray the Truth, and that great numbers in <hi>Spain</hi> were of his mind.

Sev. l. <hi>2.</hi> p. <hi>159.</hi> &amp;c.</note> are call'd for, and being circumvented by crafty but fair pretences, were told, that the Difference was not great, consisting only in one word, a thing not worth contending about, that the word <hi>Substance,</hi> which was the great bone of Contention, was ambiguous, and had been rashly taken up by the Fathers without any Authority from the Scripture, and that the true Faith was, that the Son was like the Father (though therein lay a pernicious Fallacy, they owning him to be like indeed, but not equal to the Father.) With these and some other Artifices, the Legates were prevail'd with to consent to them, and to communicate with the <hi>Arians;</hi> after which they were dismist, and Orders sent to <hi>Taurus</hi> the Praefect, not to suffer the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod to break up; till they had all yielded to the prescribed Form, and that they who stood out, should be all banish'd, till there were not above fifteen left. The Legates returning, were denied Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, though, they pleaded the force that had been put upon them. But the <hi>Arians</hi> growing more confident by this success, the Catholick Fathers, partly not seeing to the bottom of things, partly tir'd out with their tedious stay, came over to an agreement with the <hi>Orien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talists,</hi> not above twenty being left that made good their ground, of whom <hi>Phaebadius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Agen</hi> in <hi>France</hi> was chief. These <hi>Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> besought with the most passionate Importunities to yield; they had been now seven Months shut up in the City, that they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most starv'd by the scarcity and hardship of the Winter, and that otherwise there could be no hopes of their departure; that they should follow the Example of the most, whom they ought to think wiser than a few. <hi>Phaebadius</hi> for a while could not be wrought upon, till at last a Temper was found out, that he and his Party should have liberty to add their Explication to the Confession, which they did, and therein condemn'd <hi>Arius,</hi> and some of his main Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, though after all their Caution herein, they were craftily over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reach'd and impos'd upon. Indeed the whole Affair was transacted and carried by the Artifice and Dissimulation of <hi>Valens</hi> of <hi>Mursa,</hi> who<note n="p" place="margin">Hieron. adv. Lucif. Tom. <hi>11.</hi> p <hi>143</hi> ex Act. Synod. Arim.</note> before the whole Council, publickly profess'd that he was no <hi>Arian,</hi> and that he abhorr'd their Blasphemies. Whereupon <hi>Muso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Byzacium,</hi> a man reverenc'd by all for his Age, mov'd the Synod, that the impious Assertions charg'd upon <hi>Valens</hi> might be read and censur'd by the Council. Which was accordingly done by <hi>Claudius</hi> of the Province of <hi>Picenum.</hi> Upon reading the Paper <hi>Valens</hi> storm'd, and declar'd the Assertions were none of his, and to clear himself cried out, whoever denies that Christ the Son of God was begotten by the Father before the World, let him be accursed. Whereto the Council unanimously added their <hi>Placet.</hi> He goes on, whoever denies the Son to be like the Father according to the Scriptures; or that affirms the Son of God not to be Eternal with the Father; or that shall say, the Son of God is a Creature, as are the rest of the Creatures; or that he arose out of nothing, and not of the Father; or that there was a time when he was not a Son, let him be accursed. To all which Propositions he denounc'd a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <hi>Anathema,</hi> the Synod also adding their Suffrage to each of them. Several other Questions <hi>Claudius</hi> put to him, whereof he purg'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and this amongst the rest; whoever shall affirm that the Son of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:49523:143"/> God was indeed before all Ages, but not before all time, (this being a Fallacy under which the <hi>Arians</hi> us'd to shelter themselves) let him be accursed. Which was universally assented to, and all were pleas'd with his candid and full Confession, so that they extoll'd him to the Skies, and blam'd themselves that they had suspected him. And yet all this while there was a Snake in the Grass, which they saw not, he having cunningly shuffled in this Proposition amongst the rest, <hi>that the Son of God was not a Creature like the rest of the Creatures:</hi> the sting whereof (though they did not then discern it) lay in this, that the denying the Son to be like the rest of the Creatures, did how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever necessarily infer him to be a Creature, though in a more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime and excellent capacity than the rest. And as for the word <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi> it being cried out against as an unscriptural Term, and that which by its novelty had given great offence, the unwary Fathers consented to lay it aside, not reckoning it worth while to contend about words, so long as they thought themselves secure of the Sence. The Issue was, both Parties rested satisfied, the <hi>Arian</hi> Confession car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the day, and was publish'd abroad as the Determination of the Council of <hi>Ariminum.</hi> And plain it is throughout the whole course of the Story that the <hi>Arians</hi> mightily bore up themselves upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and Authority of this Synod, which at every turn they oppos'd<note n="o" place="margin">Vid.

                        </note> from <hi>Sabinus</hi> his Collections of Synodal Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, has given us a particular account of the Acts of this Council, whose Foot-steps we shall briefly follow. On the XXVII. of <hi>Septemb. Ann.</hi> CCCLIX. the Council was opened, when <hi>Leonas</hi> told them, that every one had liberty to propound what he pleas'd, but they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd as yet to enter upon the most important Matters, pretending that several whom they expected, were not yet arriv'd, as indeed
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:49523:144"/>
                        <hi>Macedonius</hi> of <hi>Constantinople, Basil</hi> of <hi>Ancyra,</hi> and some others had upon pretence of Indisposition or the like excus'd themselves, not knowing what might be moved in the Synod against them. And when notwithstanding <hi>Leonas</hi> urg'd they should proceed, they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, that they could propound no Questions, till first they had examin'd the Case of those Bishops that were accus'd. So that they could not agree what first to discuss, whether Matters of Faith, or the accused Bishops, and to this Confusion the Emperor's Letters did not a little contribute, sometimes commanding the one, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the other. The Issue was, the Council divided into two parts, the one headed by <hi>Acacius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Caesarea, George</hi> of <hi>Alexandria, Ʋranius</hi> of <hi>Tyre,</hi> and <hi>Endoxius</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> to whom about thirty others joyn'd themselves; the other manag'd by <hi>George</hi> of <hi>Laodicea, Sophronius</hi> of <hi>Pompeiopolis, Eleusius</hi> of <hi>Cyzicum,</hi> followed by the far greater part of the Synod. It being determin'd that Matters of Faith should be handled first, <hi>Acacius</hi> and his Party contended that the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed should be abolish'd, and another Form drawn up. The other side were in all things for adhering to the Synod of <hi>Nice,</hi> only that the word <hi>Consubstantial</hi> should be left out. The Dispute held till night, when <hi>Silvanus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Tarsus</hi> stood up and spake aloud, that no new Confession should be made, but that that which had many years since been agreed on at <hi>Antioch,</hi> in the Synod assembled for the <hi>Dedication,</hi> should be ratified. Which said, the <hi>Acacians</hi> withdrew, and the others producing the <hi>Antiochian</hi> Confession, read it in the Synod, and so ended that Session.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. THE next day being met in Council, they shut the doors, and subscrib'd the Confession of <hi>Antioch,</hi> Deputies subscribing for those Prelates that could not attend the Council. This furnish'd <hi>Acacius</hi> and his Followers with a plausible Objection, who said that those doings must needs be nought, that were forc'd to seek Privacy, and could not bear the open light. The Truth is, they had them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves drawn up another Confession, which they had privately shewn to <hi>Leonas</hi> and <hi>Lauricius,</hi> and which they were passionately desirous should take place. The third day <hi>Leonas</hi> took great pains to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade both Parties to meet together in the Synod, at what time <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonius</hi> of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and <hi>Basil</hi> of <hi>Ancyra</hi> were come, who joyn'd with the moderate Party. At this the <hi>Acacians</hi> were afresh offended, (they being the chief Persons excepted against) and refus'd to come into the Council, till they who had been depos'd, and all that were accus'd, were first dismiss'd. Which being granted for quietness-sake, they came in; when <hi>Leonas</hi> acquainted the Synod that <hi>Acacius</hi> had given him a Paper (which he did not tell them was a Confession of Faith, nor did they suspect it) which he commanded to be read together with the Preface to it<note n="t" place="margin">Ext. ap.

                        </note>, wherein they set forth, <q>that having ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Emperor's command come to the Synod, they had made it their business, that the Peace of the Church might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd, and Matters of Faith fairly and orderly debated, and that nothing might be obtruded upon the Faith of the Church, but what was contain'd in the holy Scriptures. But forasmuch as some in the Council had affronted several of their Party, silenc'd others, excluded others, when as they themselves had brought some into the Synod that were depos'd, and others unduly and uncanonically
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:49523:145"/> ordained, so that the Council was fill'd with Tumult and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; for this Cause they were forc'd to declare, that they did not decline the Confession agreed on, and promulgated in the <hi>Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> at <hi>Antioch,</hi> which they own'd and produc'd at every turn, but because these words <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>To these Subscriptions there is a Note added in <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole number to be XLIII. whereas being reckoned by parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, they amount to no more than XXXIX. To supply this, a man might be apt to suspect that the four Bishops, <hi>viz. Basil, Marc, Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratius,</hi> and <hi>Hypatianus</hi> (whom <hi>Epiphanius</hi> but just before mentions as present and subscribing) should be taken in. But that Passage (as 'tis judiciously corrected both by <hi>Petavius</hi>
                        <note n="u" place="margin">Animadv. in Epiph. p. <hi>326.</hi>
                        </note>, and <hi>Valesius</hi>
                        <note n="w" place="margin">Annot. in Socr. p. <hi>36.</hi>
                        </note> with little or no Alteration) plainly refers to their subscribing the Confession of Faith at <hi>Sirmium.</hi> It remains therefore that that Note was not originally put down by <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> but added by some later hand, which heedlesly reckoning upon those four Bishops, summ'd up the whole number into XLIII. But omitting that, come we to the thing it self. The Synod was not a little surpriz'd at the Matter, <hi>Sophronius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Pompeiopolis</hi> crying out, if for any man that will, every day to declare his Opinion, be to be accounted a Confession of Faith, we shall soon be left destitute of a measure and rule of Truth. In the fourth Session held the day after <hi>Acacius</hi> told them, that it could not be inconvenient to draw up now a new Confession, seeing the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed it self had been oft chang'd and altered. <hi>Eleusius</hi> of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zicum</hi> replied, that the Synod was now met not to learn what it had not learn'd already, nor to receive a Faith which it had not before, but that insisting upon the Faith deriv'd to them from their Fathers, (meaning that of the Synod of <hi>Antioch</hi>) they should not suffer either Life or Death to part between them and it.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. AFTER this they began to examine the <hi>Acacian</hi> Confession, and ask'd in what sence they held the Son to be like the Father; the <hi>Acacians</hi> answered, that they affirm'd him to be like in Will only, not in Substance; all the rest affirming him to be so in Substance and Essence. The day was spent in this Dispute, several confuting <hi>Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> out of his own Books, wherein he had maintain'd the Son to be like in all things to his Father, asking how he had face now to deny it. He replied (and it was it seems the best answer he had at hand)
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:49523:146"/> that none either of the Ancients or Moderns was to be judg'd out of his Writings. The wrangling, as in such Cases is usual, grew higher, and the Dispute grew more warm and hot, till <hi>Eleusius</hi> stood up and spake to this purpose, whether <hi>Basil</hi> and <hi>Marc</hi> have done any thing between themselves, and whether they and the <hi>Acacians</hi> do mutually charge one another about private Matters, the Synod is not concern'd to enquire, nor is it necessary curiously to examine whether their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession be good or bad; but it becomes us to embrace the Faith agreed upon by our Elders, the XCVII. Prelates that conven'd at <hi>Antioch;</hi> and that if any dare to introduce any other besides this, he be accounted as cast out from Religion and the Church. This Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course was receiv'd with general Acclamation, and the Synod for that time dismiss'd. The next day the <hi>Acacians</hi> refus'd to come to the Council, and so did <hi>Leonas,</hi> who now openly declar'd on their side, and the Messengers that came from the Synod found them assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in his House. He sent them word that the Synod was divided, and that he was commanded by the Emperor, not to be present, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less they could all agree, that therefore they might go and prate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the Church. The <hi>Acacians</hi> were often cited, but they sometimes requir'd that certain Bishops might be sent to <hi>Leonas</hi> his House to confer with them, sometimes affirm'd that the Emperor had impow'red them to judge others. So that nothing further could be done, whereupon the Synod proceeded to censures, deposing <hi>Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius, George</hi> of <hi>Alexandria, Ʋranius</hi> of <hi>Tyre, Leontius</hi> of <hi>Tripoly, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxius</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and some others; and excommunicating <hi>Asterius, Eusebius, Abgarus,</hi> and six more, till they had purg'd themselves of the Crimes charg'd upon them. An account of all which they sent in Letters directed to the several Churches, and so the Synod dissolv'd, ten of them being appointed to wait upon the Emperor, to acquaint him what had pass'd in that Council.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. BUT the <hi>Acacians</hi> were too nimble for them, and got first to Court, where they told their Tale enough to their own Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, casting Reproaches upon the Synod, which they affirm'd to have been an Assembly of leud wicked men, met together to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction and Ruine of the Church. Besides partly by Pretexts of Truth, partly by Bribes, partly by Flattery and subtle Insinuations they had made the great men of the Court on their side; amongst whom <hi>Acacius,</hi> who was a man of quick Parts, well-spoken, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely active and diligent, and not a little regarded for his eminent Station in the Church, and his Relation to the great <hi>Eusebius</hi> his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessor, had a considerable Interest. The Emperor was lately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd from the Western Parts to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where they met him, who was so incenss'd at the Suggestions which <hi>Acacius</hi> and his Party had made, that he resolv'd to crush the opposite side, and turn'd out all of that Party out of all publick Offices. And the better to effect their purpose, they perswaded the Emperor to convene a Synod; which consisted partly of <hi>Western</hi> Bishops, to wit, the Legates of the Council of <hi>Ariminum,</hi> lately come to wait upon the Emperor, partly of <hi>Libyan</hi> Bishops, <hi>Serras, Stephanas,</hi> and some others, but the Major part were the Bishops of the <hi>East,</hi> especially they of the Province of <hi>Bithynia,</hi> as being next at hand, the chief of whom was <hi>Maris</hi> of <hi>Chalcedon.</hi> There met to the number of fifty Bishops, or as

                        </note> into two principal Factions, the one of the <hi>Semtarian</hi> or <hi>Homoiousian</hi> Party, under the conduct of <hi>Basil</hi> of <hi>Ancyra,</hi> and <hi>Eusta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thius</hi> of <hi>Sebastea;</hi> the other of the <hi>Heterousians,</hi> who held the Son to be of a quite different nature from the Father. The chief Heads of this Party were <hi>Maris</hi> Bishop of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> and <hi>Eudoxius</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and with them sided <hi>Acacius,</hi> not so much out of kindness to their Opinion, as out of spite to <hi>Basil</hi> for shewing respect and honour to <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> whom he had depos'd. But they who appear'd most in the business were <hi>Aetius</hi> and <hi>Eunomius,</hi> who though they were but Deacons, yet being bold forward men, and quick nimble Disputants, were made choice of to enter the Lists as Champions on this side. Which when <hi>Basil</hi> and his Party perceiv'd, they declin'd the Contest, saying, 'twas an indecent thing for Bishops to dispute with Deacons about Matters of Faith. The other side replied, that the Dispute was not now about Dignity and Precedence, but to search and find out the Truth. So <hi>Basil</hi> unwillingly condescended to the Debate, wherein (if we may believe my Author, a Favourer of the <hi>Aetian</hi> side,) he was so utterly and irrecoverably baffled by <hi>Aetius,</hi> that he not only confess'd that the Son was wholly of a different Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from the Father, and had no manner of Communication with it, but at <hi>Aetius</hi> his request ratified this Confession with his own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription. However <hi>Constantius</hi> finding the Distractions that were in the Council, and that he might not seem altogether to slight the late <hi>Seleucian</hi> Synod, at the instance of the Legates, (the Principal whereof were <hi>Eustathius</hi> of <hi>Armenia, Basil</hi> of <hi>Ancyra, Sylvanus</hi> of <hi>Tarsus,</hi> and <hi>Eleusi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Hereupon <hi>Eustathius</hi> took up the Argument, <hi>And since, Sir,</hi> (said he) <hi>you desire Matters of Faith should be determin'd, behold what Blasphemies</hi> Eudoxius <hi>has vomited up against the only begotten Son of God.</hi> And with that presented him a Confession, wherein were these words: <hi>Those things that are produc'd after a diverse manner, are dis-like in substance. There is one God the Father, of whom are all things, and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things. But</hi> of whom, <hi>and</hi> by whom <hi>are things unlike; therefore the Son is unlike God the Father.</hi> The Emperor was startled at this, and ask'd <hi>Eudoxius</hi> whether this was his Writing, who disown'd it, and cast it upon <hi>Aetius,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sent for, and shew'd the Confession, was ask'd whether he was the Author of it. He not knowing how things stood, and hoping that it made for his Credit and Advantage, own'd it to be his; whereat the Emperor immediately sentenc'd him to be banish'd to <hi>Pepuza</hi> a Town in <hi>Phrygia,</hi> and he was disgracefully turn'd out of the Palace. Then <hi>Eustathius</hi> charg'd <hi>Eudoxius</hi> to be of the same Opinion, and that <hi>Aetius</hi> had written this by his direction, as appear'd in, that none but he could tell <hi>Aetius</hi> to be the Author. But Judges (said the Emperor) ought not to proceed by Conjectures, but accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately to examine Matters of Fact. If it be not so (replied the Bishop)
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:49523:147"/> let <hi>Eudoxius</hi> convince us of the contrary, by denouncing an <hi>Anathema</hi> to this Confession of <hi>Aetius;</hi> which the Emperor judging reasonable, commanded him to do it. But the man began to baffle, and sought to elude it by Arts and Tricks: Which the Emperor perceiving, threat'ned to send him after <hi>Aetius,</hi> if he did not do it, which he then did, condemning that Doctrine which both then and afterwards he constantly maintain'd. And when he urg'd, that <hi>Eustathius</hi> also ought to condemn the word <hi>Consubstantial,</hi> as not found in Scripture, <hi>Sylvanus</hi> answered, that the <gap reason="foreign">

Which the Emperor granting, commanded the <hi>Eudoxians</hi> to condemn them. This at first they refus'd, till perceiving the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror to resent their obstinacy, they unwillingly did it, but ceas'd not still to urge the condemning the word <hi>Consubstantial.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Sylvanus</hi> turning to the Emperor, press'd them with this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if God the Word be neither made out of nothing, nor be a Creature, nor of any other Substance (these being the Expressions which they had but just now condemn'd) then he must be <hi>Consubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> with God the Father, as being God of God, and Light of Light, and have the very same Nature with him that begat him. (Though how <hi>Sylvanus,</hi> who sided with the <hi>Semiarians,</hi> could so strongly plead for the <hi>Consubstantial</hi> Doctrine, <hi>Theodorit</hi> must answer for it.) The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument was unanswerable, but had no success; yea, the <hi>Acacian</hi> and <hi>Eudoxian</hi> Party rais'd a great Noise and Clamour, insomuch that the Emperor was angry with the other side, and threatned Banishment. <hi>Sylvanus</hi> and the rest resolutely told him, that he might appoint what punishment he pleas'd, but it belong'd to them to determine concerning Matters of Piety and Impiety, and that they would never betray the Doctrine of their Ancestors. Upon which the Emperor gave Sentence of Banishment against them, and commanded their Churches to be anew supplied.</p>
                     <p n="5">V.

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:49523:148"/> all Parties consented, each concluding him of their side.

But no sooner was he setled here (where he was receiv'd with great Demonstrations of Joy, and with an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Confluence and Acclamation of the People) but he put all out of doubt, openly declaring himself for the Catholick Doctrine.

The People were infinitely pleas'd to hear him, and intreated him to give them some short Memorial of his Doctrine, which he did by shewing them three of his Fingers, and then contracting two, one only was left, adding, to declare his meaning, there are three which are conceiv'd in the mind, though we seem to speak but to one. Which his Adversaries stretch'd, as if he had meant it in the <hi>Sabelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> sence. <hi>Sozomen</hi> sayes, that while he was preaching, the Arch-Deacon (who was of the opposite Faction) ran to him, and with his hand stop'd his Mouth, who thereupon made the Signal with his Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers which we mention'd, and when the Arch-Deacon laid hold upon his hand to hinder him, he declar'd his meaning with a loud voice, and exhorted his Auditory to stand to the <hi>Nicene</hi> Faith, protesting that all others were erroneous and false. But however it was, his Adversaries were enrag'd, and procur'd him to be banish'd, and <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoius,</hi> an old Companion of <hi>Arius</hi>'s, and who, when Deacon, had been depos'd by <hi>Alexander,</hi> to be ordain'd Bishop in his room.

The Synod calling the Case before them, demanded the Prosecutor and Accuser; but none appear'd. For <hi>Acacius</hi> who thought to carry his Design by his Power and Interest with the Emperor, and never intended it should come under a Synodal Discussion, declin'd the Process, and would not appear. For which the Emperor began to suspect him, as one that had acted herein rather out of Malice, than any good intent, and therefore commanded him to be immediately gone to his own See.</p>

Being come to a place call'd <hi>Mopsucrenae</hi> in the Confines of <hi>Cappadocia</hi> and <hi>Cilicia,</hi> his Spirits fail'd, and he expir'd, having first been baptiz'd by <hi>Euzoius,</hi> and having ordain'd (at leastwise it was so given out) <hi>Julian</hi> to be his Successor in the Empire. He died <hi>October</hi> the Vth. <hi>Ann.</hi> CCCLXI. in the XLVth. year of his Age, and XXXVIIIth. of his Reign, having ruled XIII. years with his Father, and XXV. alone. His body was brought to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and after some time buried with a pompous Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, <hi>Julian</hi> himself walking before the Corps in a mournful Posture, having put off his Crown, and without any other ensign of Majesty upon him, than the Imperial Cloak. He was a Prince of a lofty Mind, careful to preserve the <hi>Decorum</hi> of State and Empire, a rigid Exactor of Discipline, especially in Military Matters, fortunate in vanquishing intestine Divisions, and home-bred Usurpations, unsuccessful in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Expeditions. A great Master of those private Vertues that adorn a Prince, sober, chast, and temperate, kind and bountiful to his Friends and Followers, but of a Temper inclin'd to Cruelty, especially where there was the least Suspition of attempting the Empire, (seen above others in putting to death so many of his nearest Relations) which yet he sought to cover with a smooth plausible Carriage. He was greatly Uxorious, and wholly given up to the conduct of Eunuchs and Flatterers, who stood about him, and admir'd all his Sayings as Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and made his affirmation or denial the Measure and Rule of Truth; they fill'd all great Offices in the Palace, and were the Springs that steer'd all publick Affairs, oppressing in the mean time and fleecing the People, and doing innumerable Mischiefs under the shadow of his Authority.

He under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood little of the Controversies then started, which yet he curiously enquir'd into, and vigorously endeavoured to compose, by striving to draw all Parties to be of his mind and way, convening Synods for that purpose at every turn, (the Expences whereof were commonly born at his cost) so that his whole Reign seem'd nothing but so many several Sessions of one Ecclesiastick <hi>Diet.</hi> This laid him open to all the Impostures and Insinuations of the <hi>Arian</hi> Party, who fed his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, and abus'd his Power, whereby they stain'd his Reign with the Blood and Ruine of more Catholick Christians, then perhaps had suffered under any one Heathen Emperor.

But when they were come to the Chancel, or innermost part of the Temple, and had cleered the Rubbish, they found a great number of dead mens Sculls, both of Young and Old, who had been slain there in order to their Charms and Magick Rites, together with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Images, and Instruments which the Priests had us'd in their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices and impious Mysteries.

In which Faith holy men have suffered Martyrdom, and being dissolv'd, are now at rest in the Lord, and which had for ever remain'd pure and intire, if the wickedness of some Hereticks had not presumed to corrupt it. For a certain Person named <hi>Arius,</hi> together with his Followers, made it his business to deprave it, and to bring in Impiety in its room, asserting the Son of God to be made out of nothing, to be a Creature and a Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and to be mutable; with which Discourses they seduc'd many, so that some who seem'd to be of greatest account were led aside with their blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous Insinuations.

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:49523:154"/> to at <hi>Nice,</hi> that you may understand with how much accuracy it was drawn up, and how widely they err from the Truth, who maintain any other Doctrine. Know therefore, most Religious Emperor, that this is the Faith which was preach'd from the beginning, agreed upon by the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers, and afterwards own'd and subscrib'd by all the Churches in the World, by those of <hi>Spain,</hi> of <hi>Britain, Gaul,</hi> by all <hi>Italy, Campania, Dalmatia, Dacia, Mysia, Macedonia,</hi> and all <hi>Achaia;</hi> by all the Churches of <hi>Africk, Sardinia, Cyprus, Crete, Pamphylia, Lycia</hi> and <hi>Isauria;</hi> all <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Libya, Pontus</hi> and <hi>Galatia,</hi> and the Regions round about, and in short, by all the Churches of the <hi>East,</hi> a few only excepted, who em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Sentiments of <hi>Arius.</hi> The opinion of all these Churches in this Case we have known upon Trial, and have their Letters to produce. And though some few dissent from this Faith, yet we know, Sir, that a few cannot pre-judge the consent of the whole World; and being long since in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with <hi>Arianism,</hi> they do at this time most pertinaciously oppose the Truth. Now that your Piety may know the Faith publish'd by the <hi>CCCXVIII.</hi> Fathers at <hi>Nice,</hi> though a thing sufficiently known, we have here set it down. It runs thus, <hi>We believe in one God, the Father Almighty,</hi> &amp;c. In this Faith, Sir, we ought to continue, as being Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Apostolical, nor may any man alter it by plausible pretences, or sophistical Reasonings, as the <hi>Arians</hi> have done all along, who affirm the Son of God to be made of nothing, that there was a time when he was not, that he was made, created, and is mutable. For this Reason the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> as we said before, condemn'd that Heresie, and explained the true Faith. For they did not affirm the Son to be simply and absolutely like the Father, that so he might not be believed to be simply like to God, but to be true God of God. Moreover they affirmed him to be <hi>Consubstantial,</hi> which is the Property of a true genuine Son begotten of a true natural Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Nor did they separate the holy Ghost from the Father and the Son, but rather glorified him together with the Father and the Son, in the one Faith of the holy Trinity, there being but one God-head in the holy Trinity.</p>

The Emperor answered, that Accusations made ten, twenty, or thirty years ago, were past and laid aside, that they should say nothing to him of <hi>Athanasius,</hi> for that he knew wherefore he had been accus'd and banish'd. The men were not discourag'd with this ill success, but told the Emperor at the next meeting, that they had other Charges against <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and requested that they might have any man but him to be their Bishop, and that if he come amongst them, the whole City would be infested, and no man would joyn in his Religious Assemblies. To this the Emperor answered, that he had already told them, he had settled <hi>Athanasius</hi>'s Affairs, and that upon strict enquiry he had found him Orthodox, and to teach true Catholick Doctrine. They replied, that he spake well indeed, but dissembled in his heart. That, said the Emperor, is enough, which your selves testifie of him, that he speaks well, and preaches truly; and if with his Tongue he teaches right, but believes amiss in his heart, he is in that Case answerable only unto God. For we that are men, can but hear what is spoken, 'tis God only knows what is in the heart. And when they complain'd that he declar'd them to be Hereticks and Innovators in Religion, the Emperor said, that in this he did but his Duty, and that it was the part of all Catholick Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers. After this, and some other trifling Requests, the Emperor dismiss'd them for that time, commanding them to meet together and consult the next day; and after their breaking up told them, that the Bishops were there ready, that each of them should draw up the Confession of his Faith; that <hi>Athanasius</hi> was there too (for by this time he and his Company were come to <hi>Antioch</hi>) and that whoever was ignorant, or unsatisfied in the Faith, might learn of him. The Issue of the several Addresses and Conferences was, that <hi>Euzoius</hi> the <hi>Arian</hi> Bishop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> who improv'd all his Interest to settle <hi>Lucius</hi> in the See of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> lost his labour, <hi>Lucius</hi> himself was command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be gone, and quietly to behave himself; <hi>Probatius</hi> Lord Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain, and the other Eunuchs (who at <hi>Euzoius</hi>'s Instigation had stickled hard for <hi>Lucius</hi> and the <hi>Arian</hi> Cause) chastis'd and punish'd, the Emperor proclaiming, that whoever should dare to undertake any such Cause against Christians, should be serv'd in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. After this, <hi>Athanasius</hi> was honourably dismiss'd by the Emperor, with great Commendations of his Vertue and the Integrity of Life, his Wisdom and Prudence, as well as his orthodox Belief.</p>

Amongst these the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Party appear'd very forward, <hi>Basil</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ancyra, Silvanus</hi> of <hi>Tarsus, Sophronius</hi> of <hi>Pompeiopolis</hi> and some others, presented a Petition in behalf of the <hi>Homoiousians,</hi> and against the <hi>Anomaeans,</hi> wherein they set forth, that they bless'd God for advancing his Majesty to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, desiring him either that those
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:49523:155"/> things might be ratified, which had been concluded in the Synods of <hi>Ariminum</hi> and <hi>Seleucia,</hi> and those things cancell'd, which by some mens Power and Interest had been effected; or else that the breach remaining in the Churches as it was before those Synods, the Bishops from all places might meet together in what place they pleas'd, and freely debate things amongst themselves, none else being admitted into their Society; and that the attempts of any who had a mind to act clandestinely, and to impose upon others, (as had been done in the time of the Emperor <hi>Constantius</hi>) might not be suffered to take effect. That they had not themselves come to Court, lest their Numbers might give offence; but if commanded, they were most ready to do it at their own Charge. The Emperor taking their Petition, gave them no other answer, but that he hated Contention, but lov'd and honour'd all that were Studious of Peace and Concord. Much about the same time a Synod was held at <hi>Antioch,</hi> wherein the <hi>Acacian</hi> Party tack'd about, and made it appear that they could at any time be of the Emperor's Religion, and therefore readily joyn'd with the rest in confirming the <hi>Nicene Consubstantial</hi> Doctrine, which they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to the Emperor in this following Address.</p>

                                 <p>WE are not ignorant, most Pious Emperor, that it is your Majesties chief Care and Study, to promote the Peace and Concord of the Church; nor are we ignorant that you very rightly apprehend a Form of the true orthodox Faith, to be the Foundation of this Ʋnity. Therefore that we may not seem to be of the number of those that corrupt the true Doctrine, we acquaint your Piety, that we embrace and firmly maintain the Faith heretofore agreed on in the holy Synod of <hi>Nice.</hi> For the word <hi>Consubstantial,</hi> which to some seem'd new and strange, was cautiously ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by those Fathers, so as to signifie that the Son is begotten of the Substance of the Father, and that he is in substance like unto the Father; so as neither any Passion may be understood to be in that ineffable Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor the word <hi>Substance</hi> be taken according to the Ʋse and Custom of the <hi>Greeks;</hi> but so as to overthrow what <hi>Arius</hi> presum'd to assert, that the Son was made out of nothing. Which also the Ʋpstart <hi>Anomaeans</hi> do with a greater Boldness and Impudence affirm, to the rending asunder the Peace and Agreement of the Church. And for this Reason we have to this our Address annex'd a Copy of the Creed compos'd by the Bishops in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, which we also own, and is as follows. <hi>We believe in one God, the Father Almighty,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

But the change of Affairs by the Succession of <hi>Jovian</hi> to the Crown, and the late Council at <hi>Antioch</hi> that had expresly condemned the <hi>Anomaean</hi> Doctrine, had broke their Measures, and <hi>Euzoius</hi> thought best to proceed no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in that Matter. Whereupon <hi>Aetius</hi> and <hi>Eunomius,</hi> who were at this time at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> conceiv'd it high time to look after their own Affairs, and to strengthen and secure their Interest in all places. To which purpose they consecrated several new Bishops of their Sect; at <hi>Constantinople</hi> they ordain'd <hi>Poemenius,</hi> who dying soon after <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentius</hi> succeeded in his room; <hi>Thallus</hi> at <hi>Lesbus, Euphronius</hi> for <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latia</hi> and <hi>Cappadocia, Julian</hi> for <hi>Cilicia; Theophilus</hi> the <hi>Indian</hi> was sent to <hi>Antioch</hi> to perswade <hi>Euzoius</hi> to perfect what he had begun in the Cause of <hi>Aetius,</hi> and upon refusal, to take the Charge of that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple upon himself. In <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Libya, Serras</hi> and his Brethren were to administer the Affairs and Interests of the Party. Over the Churches of <hi>Lydia</hi> and <hi>Ionia</hi> they set <hi>Candidus</hi> and <hi>Arianus,</hi> whom <hi>Aetius</hi> himself accompanied home to give them Possession of their Charge. But he met with an Opposition which he look'd not for. For one <hi>Theophilus</hi> a Bishop of his own Faction, set himself against him, and associating with <hi>Phaebus,</hi> and seven Bishops more, met in a Synodal Assembly, and protested against him and his Proceedings, and wrote Letters to <hi>Eudoxius,</hi> and <hi>Maris</hi> of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> wherein they charg'd <hi>Aetius</hi> his Ordination as irregular and uncanonical, and that when he had been degraded from his Deaconship, he had without the leave and allowance of his Deposers, invaded the Episcopal Office. They disown'd the Ordinations he had given to <hi>Candidus</hi> and <hi>Arianus,</hi> and any of the rest, as Acts done rashly, and without the common Suffrage. The Letter was very wellcome to <hi>Eudoxius,</hi> who highly resented <hi>Aetius</hi> his ordaining a Bishop under his own Nose at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> and wrote back to <hi>Theophilus</hi> and his Associates, that they should go on vigorously in what they had begun, and proceed severely rather against <hi>Aetius</hi> and the rest of the Ordainers, than against those who had been ordained by them, and perhaps he might at that time be the more tender in the Case of <hi>Candidus</hi> and <hi>Arianus,</hi> because they were near akin to the Emperor <hi>Jovian,</hi> and had gone to him while he lay yet at <hi>Edessa,</hi> to solicit him against <hi>Athanasius.</hi> But he wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concealing his own Opinion, refer'd the Matter to a more publick Assembly, which soon after met, when he arriv'd at <hi>Antioch.</hi> Afterwards <hi>Eudoxius</hi> wrote likewise to <hi>Euzoius</hi> to engage him against <hi>Candidus</hi> and <hi>Arianus.</hi> But he rejected the Motion with some Indignation, and in his answer rebuk'd the Rashness and Confidence of the man, and advis'd him to let fall that design, calmly putting him in mind of his great neglect in not performing what he had solemnly engag'd to do in the behalf of <hi>Aetius.</hi> This Opposition, and the mutual feuds of these great men gave a notable check to the <hi>Anomaean</hi> Faction, and made the Catholick Cause, lately espous'd by the Council at <hi>Antioch,</hi> run more cleer and smooth.</p>

<pb n="194" facs="tcp:49523:160"/> succinctly though sufficiently treated of the Idolatry and Superstition of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and its Original in the World; and having spoken something of the Divinity of the Word of God, and his universal Power and Providence, as by whom God the Father creates, governs, and disposes all things; he would now, according to his method, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to treat of the Incarnation of the Word, and his Divine coming in the Flesh, against the Calumnies of the <hi>Jews</hi> on the one hand, and the Derision of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> on the other. But his main conflict was not with open Enemies, but secret depravers of the Christian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and though as they come in his way, he spares no sort of Hereticks, confuting the <hi>Marcionites, Valentinians, Samosatenians, Sabellians, Manichees,</hi> &amp;c. yet he principally directs his Forces against the <hi>Arians,</hi> whom at every turn he beats out of all their Refuges, and this he has especially done in his five <hi>Orations</hi> against the men of that Sect, a Book which <hi>Photius</hi>

In his Historical Tracts, (in which number we must com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend his Apologetical Discourses, most-what fill'd with Matters of Fact, and wherein he more particularly stretches forth all the Nerves of his Wit and Eloquence) he gives us a cleer and distinct account of the most material Transactions of his Age; and for which alone we can never pay a sufficient Tribute of thankfulness to his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, who otherwise had been left miserably in the dark, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his Writings far more, and far better accounts of the State of those times, than in all other Writers put together, indeed little in others, but what is borrowed from him, and what commonly fares worse by falling into other hands. Nor has he escap'd the Fate of all wise and excellent Writers, to be abus'd by others. For besides that Hereticks made bold sometimes to corrupt his Writings (an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance whereof <hi>Rufinus</hi>

Whereupon he set himself to contemplate the visible Frame of things, and to conclude that the same Power that made, must preserve and steer all things, that in an almighty and incorruptible Being, there could be no Sexes, no successive Generations, that the Author of all could have nothing without himself, and that Omnipotency and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity were necessary and incommunicable Perfections of the divine Nature, incapable of agreeing to any more than one. While he was engag'd in these and such-like Reflections, he met with the Books of the Old Testament, wherein he was greatly surpriz'd with that short, but comprehensive account of God, <hi>I am that I am.</hi> This put him upon further researches, and he was infinitely delighted with his Speculations concerning the Nature and Perfections of God, to pursue the knowledge of whom (so far as attainable) he reckoned to be one of the most kindly Offices he could perform to his great Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. In this pursuit he was mightily encourag'd by the natural Sence he had of future Rewards, and that it was not enough only to have right Notions of God, unless there was a lively hope that good men should be happy in another Life, and that it was an unworthy apprehension of God, to conceive that so noble a being as the Soul of man, made to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, adore, and enjoy its Maker, should expire with the last breach. From hence he proceeded to survey the Revelation of the Gospel, and so ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd to the knowledge of God the Son, and the great end and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of his coming into the World, the Divinity of his Person, and the great Mystery of his Incarnation, that he was <hi>God of God, the Word that was God,</hi> and <hi>that in the beginning was with God,</hi> of the same Nature, Glory, and Eternity with his Father, <hi>the Word that was made flesh,</hi> being both God and Man in one Person. Furnish'd with this accurate knowledge of the Christian Doctrine, he was baptiz'd, or to use his own Phrase<note n="c" place="margin">

A good part of his time he spent in instructing others, explaining to them the Nature and Principles of Religion, and informing them in the right Belief of the holy Trinity, other-whiles perswading them to the Vertues of a good Life, by laying before them the infinite Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of Heaven and Immortality.

In this Journey<note n="y" place="margin">V. Fortun. in vit.

Whose Example her Father <hi>Florentius</hi> following, was, together with his whole Family baptiz'd into the Christian Faith. Nor was the Maid satisfied with this, but taking leave of her Parents, followed him in all his Travels, and attended him to his own House at <hi>Poictiers,</hi> saying, that herein she thought her self more oblig'd to her spiritual, than to her natural Father. Being arriv'd at <hi>Seleucia,</hi> he was gladly receiv'd by those few Catholick Bishops that were there, but rejected by the rest, till he had clear'd an Imputation laid upon him.

                     </note>, that nothing could in Substance be like to God, that in the divine Nature there could be no Generation, and that Christ was a Creature; that upon the account of his Creation, he was said to be born, but that he was made of nothing, and consequently was neither Son, nor like to God. Nay, what was the excess of Blasphemy and Prophaness, it was there publickly aver'd to have been preach'd at <hi>Antioch,</hi> that in the God-head there was neither Father nor Son, and that if there were, it necessarily infer'd, that there must be a Female Partner, and all consequent Acts and Instruments of Generation. At the hearing whereof, and other the like Stuff, the Synod begun to ferment into great Tumult and Disorder. The <hi>Anomaeans</hi> considering that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Ears would never brook such impious and extravagant Asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, drew up a Form of Belief, that condemn'd the Doctrine of
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:49523:165"/> dissimilitude. Which seeming strange to the Assembly, S. <hi>Hilary</hi> ask'd one, who was set upon him to feel how he stood affected, what was the meaning, that they who had positively denied the Son to be either of the same, or like Substance with the Father, should now condemn the Doctrine of his being unlike to God. He was answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that Christ was not like to God, but to the Father. The answer made the thing more obscure and intricate than before; till upon a second enquiry the other thus explain'd himself, that when he affirm'd the Son to be unlike to God, but like to the Father, he meant, that it was the Will of the Father to make such a Creature, which should will the like things that he did, and that in that regard he was like the Father, being the Son not of his Nature, but his Will: but that he was unlike to God, being neither God, nor of God, that is, not begotten of the Substance of the Father. S. <hi>Hilary</hi> was infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely surpriz'd and amaz'd hereat, nor could believe it to be spoken in earnest, till he was publickly assur'd, that it was the Sence of the whole Party, all the <hi>Homoyousians</hi> expressing a most vehement Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrency and Detestation of it. The Conclusion was, that the <hi>Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> Party and their Form, was rejected and condemn'd, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession made twenty years since, in the Council at <hi>Antioch,</hi> (wherein was no mention of the Son's <hi>Consubstantiality</hi>) approved and ratified.</p>

                     </note> (which he seems to have pronounc'd in the Emperor's presence) wherein having first begg'd a favourable Audience, he vindicates his own Innocency against the Attempts and Insinuations of his Enemies, complains of the unhappy State of Religion at that time, that new Creeds were multiplied so fast, that the Faith was lost in a crowd of Confessions, and was shap'd according to the humor of the Age, not according to the truth of the Gospel, that they were the bravest men that could produce a Creed of the newest and the freshest Date, and most roundly denounce an <hi>Anathema</hi> against those that differed from them: <hi>Annuas, atque menstruas de Deo fides decernimus,</hi>
                     <q>Admirable Stewards (sayes he) of divine and invisible Mysteries, we compose new Creeds every year, yea every month, we make Decrees, and then recall them, defend them, and then anathematize those that do so, either in our own, we condemn others, or in sentencing others, we condemn our own, and while <hi>we bite one another, we are devour'd one of another.</hi>
                     </q> In these acute Reflections he spends a good part of his Oration, managing the Argument with great salt and smartness, and whereas his Majesty requir'd a Faith agreeable to the divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations, he besought him to give him leave to discourse a while
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:49523:166"/> before him and the Synod (then assembled at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and torn in pieces with Heats and Animosities) concerning the Faith out of the holy Scriptures, and to undertake the Cause of Christ, whose Bishop he was, and for whose sake he now suffered Banishment; and this the rather, because the worst of Hereticks pretended to derive their impious and blasphemous Belief out of the Scriptures. Whereas the Scriptures lye not in the Letter but the Sence, and become useful not barely by reading, but by understanding, and are understood not by subtlety, but by Love and Charity. And that he might give him a <hi>Specimen</hi> of what he would discourse on before so great an Assembly, and upon so famous and controverted an Argument, and what he hoped would turn to the Honour of his Reign, the Glory of the Faith, and the Peace and Settlement both of the <hi>Eastern</hi> and <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern,</hi> Churches, he concludes with a brief Account of his Faith, that Faith which he had received at his Baptism, and which was according to the Doctrine of the Gospel.</p>

But whoever considers, with what intolerable Sharpness and Severity (to say no worse) he treats the Emperor in that Discourse, how in his transports of Zeal, he styles him Anti-christ, (and justifies it too from Scripture) fighter against God, the new Enemy of Christ, the Destroyer of Religion, a Tyrant in the things of God, a Persecutor beyond the Rage of <hi>Nero, Decius,</hi> or <hi>Maximian,</hi> the wickednest of men, with much more to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, must needs think that no man of a far greater Patience than <hi>Constantius</hi> would have endured to have been told so to his face, and that such an Address could not have been made at less cost than the price of his Head; and consequently must conclude, either that he suppress'd it during his life, or (which is most probable) wrote it after his death, in the beginning of <hi>Julian</hi>'s Reign, when a man might, if not with encouragement, at least with safety, talk at that rate.

The Artifices that had been us'd in the Synod at <hi>Ariminum,</hi> had involv'd almost all the Bishops of the <hi>West</hi> in the guilt of <hi>Arian</hi> Compliance, the natural Effect whereof was Distrust and Quarrels, Divisions and Separations, the Sound shun'd the infected, and one man refus'd to converse and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with another.

Not to mention the palpable Violence that he must needs offer to his own Conscience. Perhaps something tending that way, might have been spread by the Malice of the Faction, and the thing improv'd by going from hand to hand; or S. <hi>Hilary</hi>'s Enemies might have sentenc'd him in some of their clancular Assemblies, and <hi>Rufi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> meeting the Report, heedlesly took it up, and it may be added some Circumstances to make it out.

                  <p n="14">XIV. THUS by the Care and Industry of this great man, things were tolerably pacified in the <hi>West,</hi> and so continued for some years, when <hi>Auxentius</hi> of <hi>Milan,</hi> who had been often depos'd and excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated by the Catholicks, had by Arts of Hypocrisie and Dissimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, so far wrought himself into the Favor of the Emperor <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinian,</hi> as to obtain an Edict from him for the quiet Possession of his See. Which coming to S. <hi>Hilary</hi>'s Ears, he resolv'd upon a Journey to <hi>Milan,</hi> on purpose to uncase the Fox, and to dis-abuse the well-meaning Emperor. At his arrival at Court<note n="o" place="margin">Hilar. lib. adv. Auxent. col. <hi>314, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </note>, he immediately fell upon <hi>Auxentius,</hi> whom he charg'd with Blasphemy, and with believing otherwise than he had made the Emperor and the World believe. <hi>Valentinian</hi> mov'd with the Address of so venerable a Person, refer'd the Cause to the Hearing of the Treasurer, and the Master of the Palace, who had ten Bishops as Assessors with them. At first <hi>Aux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entius</hi> excepted against the Person of his Accuser, that he ought not to be heard as a Bishop, who had been heretofore condemn'd by <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turninus.</hi> But the Court over-ruled this Plea, and resolv'd, as the Emperor had ordered, to proceed directly to Matters of Faith. And here <hi>Auxentius</hi> found himself pinch'd, and not knowing where to get out, roundly profess'd he believ'd Christ to be true God, and to be of one and the same Substance and Divinity with God the Father. This Confession was entred upon Record, and <hi>S. Hilary</hi> prevail'd with the Treasurer to present a Copy to the Emperor. Indeed <hi>Aux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entius</hi> denied all that was charg'd upon him, and in his Libel<note n="p" place="margin">Ext. Ibid. col. <hi>317.</hi>

And though, as S. <hi>Hilary</hi> observes he did but dissemble in his most ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Assertions, eluding all by subtle Distinctions and mental Reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, yet by these plausible Pretences he kept up his Reputation with the Emperor and the People, who own'd and convers'd with him as a most Catholick Bishop. S. <hi>Hilary</hi> urg'd, that all this was but Scene and Fiction, that he still denied the Faith, and did but mock God and man, but the Emperor bad him sur-cease any further Prosecution, and commanded him to be gone. So he was forc'd to return home, laden with nothing but the saisfaction of an honest and well-meant Design.</p>

He had a great Veneration for Truth, in the search whereof he refus'd no Pains or Study, and in the pursuit of it, was acted by a mighty Zeal, and in the Defence of it, us'd a freedom and liberty of Speech, that sometimes transported him beyond the bounds of Decency, as is too evident (not to name other Instances) in his Addresses to, and the Character he gives of <hi>Constantius,</hi> wherein he lets loose the Reins not to Zeal, but to Rage and Passion, and treats him with a Liberty far from being consistent with duty to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, or indeed justifiable by the common Rules of Prudence and Civility; his hearty concernment for Religion, meeting with the vigor and frankness of his Temper, the natural Genius of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, made him sometimes forget that Reverence that was due to Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors, though otherwise he was of a very sweet gentle Temper.

Under the <hi>Maximinian</hi> Persecution, one of the last, but hottest Efforts of declining <hi>Paganism,</hi> and which made all that preceded seem Humane and Gentle; his paternal Ancestors, to avoid the Fury of the Storm, fled to one of the woody Mountains of <hi>Pontus,</hi> not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but to find better Quarter from the most wild and savage Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures there, than by staying at home to encounter with Beasts in the shape of men. Here they continued near seven years, banish'd from the Comfort and Society of Friends, (a thing strange to them who had been wont to be crowded with a train of Attendants and Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers)
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:49523:171"/> and expos'd to Hunger and Cold, to Rain and Storms, and to all the Hardships of a barren and disconsolate Place. And all this the more insupportable, because falling upon Persons, whose tender and delicate Education had made them Strangers to the pressures of Want and Hardship. Till at length course Fare and hard Lodging had so far impair'd their Health, as to make them desirous of some Refreshments more suitable and grateful to the Appetites of weakned and decay'd Nature, wherewith they knew God could, if he pleas'd, easily furnish them. And the divine Providence, which is never wanting in Necessaries, is wont sometimes, though at the Expences of a Miracle, to gratifie his Servants with Delicacies. And thus it hap'ned here, for on a sudden an Herd of fat Deer came out of the Thicket, and voluntarily offered themselves to the Knife, following the Persons they met, without any other force, than the direction of a Nod. Being brought to the place of their abode, they stood still, till as many as were thought convenient were chosen out, and the rest being dismiss'd, quietly return'd back into the Woods. A Feast was hereupon immediately prepared, and our poor hunger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>starv'd Confessors liberally treated, who thankfully own'd the bounty of Heaven, and look'd upon it as an Encouragement and Obligation to go on cheerfully with their Portion of Sufferings that were yet behind. But leaving them, let us come nearer home. His imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Parents were not more famous for their mutual kindness, than for their Charity to the Poor, their Hospitality towards Strangers, the devoting a constant part of their Estate to God, their abstinence and Fasting, and all the Vertues of a good Life, all which God was pleas'd to Crown with a numerous and hopeful Issue.

This she took all imaginable care to convey and propagate to her Grand-children, planting their Minds
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:49523:172"/> with the first Seeds and Principles of Truth, as S. <hi>Basil</hi> more than once gratefully owns in his Epistles. Five years<note n="c" place="margin">Amph. ubi supr.</note> being spent in this domestick Education, and being accurately accomplish'd with all the preliminary Parts of Learning, he betook himself to travel, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and compleat his Studies.

                        </note>, the Metropolis of <hi>Palestim,</hi> famous at that time for Schools of Learning, where he soon out-went his Fellow-Pupils, and bad fair to overtake his Masters; so that he quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drew the Eyes of all Persons upon him, who reverenc'd him for his excellent Learning, but especially for his more excellent Life; and generally beheld him as a Master-Orator, and Dictator in Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy, and what's more, as a Bishop in the Church, before his years rendred him capable of those Imployments. But above all, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied himself to study the true Philosophy, to break loose from the Charms of this lower World, and to trade in divine and heavenly Things, and to barter away those things that are frail and perishing, for those that are unchangeable and eternal. From <hi>Caesarea</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> lately made the Imperial City, and flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with eminent Professors of Rhetorick and Philosophy, whose several Perfections by the quickness and comprehensiveness of his Parts, he digested into his own use and ornament; and then to crown all, went to <hi>Athens,</hi> the common Seat of Arts and Learning, where to have spent some time, was it self enough in those dayes to have given a man the Reputation of a Scholar.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. THE fame of so excellent a Person had before-hand prepar'd mens minds, and made that University big with Expectations of his coming, and every one was contriving how to gain him for their Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pil. It was the Custom at <hi>Athens,</hi> for the Youth of the University to lye in wait for the arrival of young Students, to beset all Wayes and Tracts, all Ports and Passages, that so first seizing upon them, they might either perswade or draw them in to be their Fellow-Pupils, thinking by this means to oblige their Masters, and outvy the Train of other Professors, between whom there us'd to be great Clash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Emulation. Having gain'd the fresh man, their first care was to lodge him in the House of some Friend, or Country-man, or at least of one of those Setters, that plied up and down in the behalf of that Sophist, who was to be his Tutor. Next they gave way to any that would, to pose him with hard Questions, and to run him down with Quirks and Subtleties, which were either more rude or ingenuous, according to the Humor and Education of him that put them. This they did, to baffle the good Conceit of himself, which the young man was suppos'd to bring along with him; and from the very first to subdue him into a perfect Submission to his Teachers. This being done, they conduct him in a pompous Procession through the Market-place to the publick Bath, two and two going before him
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:49523:172"/> at equal distances; being come near the place, on a sudden they rais'd a wild frantick Noise, and fetch'd many strange Frisks and Capers, knocking like mad men at the Gates, till having sufficiently frighted the young man, the Doors were opened, and he was made Free, and then they return'd and embrac'd him as their Friend and Fellow-Pupil, and a Member of the University.

At <hi>Athens</hi> he met with <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Nazianzum,</hi> (who had sometimes been his School-fellow) between whom there commenc'd so intimate and dear a Friendship (there being between them a peculiar affinity in Temper, Study, and course of Life) that nothing but their last breath could part them, they had the same Disposition, Inclination, Design, and Emulation; and as <hi>Nazianzen</hi>

                        </note> adds, they seem'd to have had but one Soul between them. One of the first Instances of Freedom and Familiarity, <hi>Nazianzen</hi> gave him upon this occasion. Some <hi>Armenian</hi> Students (a close and subtle People according to the Genius of that Nation) who had been his old Acquaintance and School-fellows, being vex'd to be out-done by a Novice, one who had but just got on the Philosophick <hi>Pallium,</hi> came to him under pretence of Friendship, and falling upon him with captious and sophistical Disputations, endeavour'd at the first attempt to beat him down. But they soon found they were over-match'd; whereupon <hi>Nazianzen</hi> to support the Honor of the University, struck in with them, and reliev'd their languishing side. But perceiving that 'twas not love to truth, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

With none would they keep company
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:49523:173"/> but the Meek and Humble, the Chast and Sober, whose Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was likely to make them better. Those Parts of Learning they mainly insisted on, not which were most pleasant, but most useful, and which were aptest to minister to Vertue and a good Life. As for Feasts, and Shews, and publick Solemnities, they wholly neglected them, reckoning it honor enough to be, and to be accounted Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; and though <hi>Athens</hi> was a dangerous place, being the great Seat of Impiety and Idolatry, yet so far were they from being tempted, that they found themselves rather confirm'd in the Truth of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, by what they dayly saw and heard. In short, the course they took, and the Improvements they made, caus'd them to be univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally taken notice of, so that they became the talk both of City and Country, their Fame spread it self all over <hi>Greece</hi> and foreign Parts, where-ever their Tutors were known, they were mention'd, the Glory of the Scholars keeping pace with the Name and Reputation of their Masters.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. <hi>BASIL</hi> had now furnish'd himself with all the Advantages which <hi>Athens</hi> could afford, the Ship was fraighted with Learning (to use his Friends<note n="m" place="margin">Nazian. ib. p. <hi>333.</hi>

                        </note>, and though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise a very good man, yet in this fell short of the ordinary Rules both of Prudence and Religion. He was himself obnoxious upon the account of his late Election, not strictly warrantable according to the standing Laws and Canons of the Church; he had to deal with a Person of a great name, and an unquestionable Reputation, and who by his Authority and Influence was able to steer a Party which way he pleas'd; besides, there were some <hi>Western</hi> Bishops (probably <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifer</hi> of <hi>Calaris,</hi> and <hi>Eusebius</hi> of <hi>Vercellae</hi>) at this time at <hi>Caesarea,</hi> who took in with those that were most zealous for the Catholick Interest. Nor did <hi>Basil</hi> stand alone in this Matter; the Monks of <hi>Caesarea,</hi> over whom he presided as their Director and Governor, presently espous'd their Master's Quarrel, and finding <hi>Eusebius</hi> unreasonable in his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, and obstinate in his Resolutions, withdrew from all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him, and drew a great part, not only of the common People, but of the Magistrates, into the Separation. Things ripen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus fast into an open breach, <hi>Basil,</hi> who was at a loss, how to behave himself in this dis-juncture of Affairs, out of a great regard to the Peace of the Church, thought it best, at least for the present, to retire into the Wilderness, wherein he was not a little sway'd by his own Inclination, to embrace the Solitudes of a private Life, where

The place he made choice of, was naturally fitted for all the Advantages of Solitude and Contemplation; it was a high <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, cloath'd with a thick shady Wood, and watered on the North with cool and Crystal Springs that issued from it. At the foot of the Hill was a fruitful Valley, the Verdure and Fertility whereof, was not a little owing to those benign Streams that flowed from the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring Hills; as for its quietness and security, it was beholden to the Woods, variegated with all sorts of pleasant Trees that encompass'd it. Nature had form'd it into a kind of <hi>Peninsula,</hi> and fortified it with Bullworks on every side; two parts of it were secured by deep and unapproachable Vallies; a third by the River, which falling from a Precipice, was a sure Wall on that side; on the other was a ragged and naked Rock, which joyning to the Valley, cut off all Avenues that way. There was but one Passage to it, and that too secur'd by those who liv'd within. It was on the most prominent part of this Mountain, that S. <hi>Basil</hi> fix'd his Cell, whence there was an easie and delightful prospect both into the Valley below, and upon the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor River, which slowing with a quick rapid Stream, and dash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it self against the Rocks that opposed its passage, at once gratified both the Eye and Ear. Nor wanted there other Divertisements to those, who were desirous to entertain themselves with innocent Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures. For as the River afforded plenty of excellent Fish, and the adjoyning Hills conveniency for Sport and Game; so the Birds from the Woods charm'd the Ear with untaught Musick, while the Eye was ravish'd to look down and behold the Plains over-spread with a natural Tapestry of Herbs and Flowers. But the greatest advantage of the place, was its Solitude, being perfectly remote from all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, not a man seen that way, unless when Hunting by chance brought them thither, and that not in quest of Beasts of prey, Wolves, Lions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (for with such the place was not infested) but of Deer, will Goats, and such like peaceable and harmless Creatures.</p>

THE good man was infinitely satisfied with the place of his Retirement, and wanted nothing to compleat his happiness, but the company of his dear Friend <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> whom he oft invited to come thither to him; In one of his Letters he elegantly describes his fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Islands (as <hi>Nazianzen</hi> calls them<note n="p" place="margin">

But having after some time broken loose from those Affairs that detain'd him, over he goes to him, and joyful, we may be sure, was the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of those two dear Companions, whose Inclinations, Studies, and way of Life ran both in the same Channel. But though so mutually conversant with each other, yet they liv'd apart in different Cells, as is plain from <hi>Nazianzen</hi>'s Epistle to <hi>Amphilocius</hi>

Indeed <hi>Basil</hi>'s Company and course of Life quickly drew others into those parts, who slying from the Noise and Troubles of the World, did after his Example, give up themselves to the Severities and Mortifications of a retired Life.

THE first thing he did after his return, was to set himself to redress the evil State of things at <hi>Caesarea;</hi> where diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences had arisen, he endeavoured to compose them; where breaches had been made, he repair'd them; his dayly Study and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration was, how to attack the Enemy, whom he so successfully assaulted at every turn, that he soon drove them quite out of the Field: Assisted in these Conflicts by his old Companion, who was to him as <hi>Barnabas</hi> to <hi>Paul</hi> (as he modestly speaks of himself) a Co-adjutor in this great Work, wherein he thought it honor enough to be a second to so great a Champion. And that the World might see that he was perfectly reconcil'd, and retain'd no resentment upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the harsh usage he had met with, he carried himself towards his Bishop with a most profound observance, whose late unkindnesses he extenuated, and represented them only as a Device and Artifice of the Devil, who envied the happiness of their Concord; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing which, he shewed how well he understood, how readily he could comply with the Laws and Canons of the Church. He was at hand in all Instances of Canonical Obedience, he was to the Bishop an Impartial Monitor, a faithful Councellor, a diligent. Co-adjutor, (especially in Preaching) a dextrous manager of business; he was, in short, the staff of his Age, the support of his Faith, the guide of his Family, and the Agent of his Affairs abroad; so that though he was below the Chair, yet the Reins of Ecclesiastical Government were lodg'd in his hands. <hi>Eusebius</hi> govern'd the People, and <hi>Basil Eusebius,</hi> who was content to shine by that lustre, which the others wise and prudent Administration of Affairs did reflect upon him. Where the Cause of the Church, or of common Equity was concern'd, he scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled not, freely to address himself to the chiefest Magistrates in the City, took up Differences amongst neighbors with so much imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, that his Decisions took effect, as if they had been ratified by Law. He was a common Advocate for the Poor, whose Right he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, and whose Wants he relieved both of Soul and Body; by his means Provision was made for their Maintenance, Hospitals erected for the entertainment of Strangers, Directions given for the Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of devout pious Virgins; sometimes he was taken up in forming Rules for those who engag'd in a Monastick Life, and these delivered

In this evil Case <hi>Basil</hi> bestirred himself, he plied the Rich with unwearied Arguments and Perswasives, till he had first opened their Hearts, and then their Purses; and having made himself Master of their Treasures, he freely dealt his Bread to the Hungry: The Poor, and those who were even starv'd to death, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of all Ranks, Ages, and Sexes, he gathered into one place, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributing Victuals to them according to their several Necessities, which he, and others by his Example, prepar'd and administ'red with his own hand, not disdaining the meanest Office, whereby he might become useful to them.

At the first News of his being Sick (for he had sent him word<note n="m" place="margin">Naz. Ep XXI. p. <hi>784.</hi>
                        </note>, that he passionately desir'd to see and speak with him, and that he must make hast, if ever he intended to see him alive) <hi>Nazianzen</hi> was extreamly afflicted, and prepar'd imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to go to him. But when he understood that all this was little more than a device to draw him to <hi>Caesarea,</hi> and that indeed the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness was the Choice of a new Bishop, he stop'd his Journey, and turn'd back. However he laid not aside the Care of that place, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd all his thoughts<note n="n" place="margin">Greg. vit. Naz. p. <hi>14.</hi>
                        </note>, and improv'd all his Interest to fix and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle that Affair; and because he knew there was none fitter than <hi>Basil,</hi> he recommended him both by publick and private Letters, wherein he had the concurrent Advice and Suffrage of his Father, a man of great Esteem and Reverence in those Parts, in whose name he wrote<note n="o" place="margin">Inter Naz.

                        </note> to the People of <hi>Caesarea,</hi> wherein he lets them know, that although he was Bishop of but an inconsiderable See, yet his Age and Interest in the common Peace and Welfare of the Church, made him equally concern'd with any; that the fixing a Bishop in any Church, was a Matter of great weight, much more at <hi>Caesarea,</hi> a place renowned for its Dignity, Antiquity, Orthodoxy, and Unity, in all which Respects the Eyes of the Christian World were from all Parts drawn upon it, like lines directed from the Circumference to the Center; that for his own part, though they had invited him to the Consultation, yet he fear'd his Age and Infirmities would not permit him to be there; and if not, yet he thought himself obliged to supply by Letters the want of his Company. He doubted not but they would have plenty of excellent and worthy Persons Candidates for the place, but that he knew none of the whole number comparable to <hi>Basil</hi> the Presbyter, a man of an exact Life, and admirable Learning and Eloquence, and in both respects the almost only Person capable to encounter the subtle and disputing Hereticks of that time. Which he intimated to all both of the Clerical, and Monastical Order, and to all the Magistrates and Senators of the City, yea, to the whole Body of the People; that if they agreed in this Proposal, he was ready to give his Suffrage, which he was assur'd was right and well grounded, and would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count himself Spiritually present at the Election, and would be the first that should lay hold upon the Person; but if otherwise they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded

                        </note> to the same effect to the Bishops that were met there about this Matter, whom he gently chides for sending him only a loose and general Invitation, without any Intimation either of the time when, or the business they were to consult about, as if they design'd on purpose to prevent his being there, lest he should oppose their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs; that for the thing it self, he knew there would be several Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons propos'd, according as their different Interest, Resolutions, or Inclinations lead them, but that he could not recommend any one like <hi>Basil,</hi> either for the exemplariness of his Life, or the charms of his Eloquence, or his incomparable attainments in all parts of Virtue. If his weakness and infirmity of body were pleaded as a Bar to hinder him, they should remember they were to choose a Bishop, not an <hi>Athleta</hi> or Champion (where a strong and robust Constitution was necessary) and that God was able enough to strengthen the infirm and weak. In this choice he would readily joyn with them, but if they proceeded with by ends, and manag'd the Affair with Parties and Factions, 'twas their own doing, and he should rejoyce to have no hand in it.</p>

The Prefect was netled at this, and Passion grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon him, he started up out of his Chair, and proceeded in a sharper strain. <hi>MOD.</hi> What then, are you not afraid of the Power we are arm'd with? <hi>BAS.</hi> What can happen?

Or if there be any thing worse than these, threaten that; for of these, there's none can reach us. <hi>MOD.</hi> How so? <hi>BAS.</hi> He is not obnoxious to Confiscation, who has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to lose: Unless you want these old tattered Cloaths, and a few Books, wherein consists my whole Estate. Banishment I regard not, who am tied to no place; I account not this Country, where I now dwell, my own; and I can think any mine, where I shall be cast: Or to speak more properly, the whole Earth is God's, whose Pilgrim and Sojourner I am. As for Tortures, what can they do, where there's not a Body to bear them? Set aside the first blow, and there's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else within your Power. And then for death, I shall esteem it a kindness and benefit; 'twill but sooner send me to God, for whose sake I live and act, and to whom I am in a great measure dead, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of a long time been hastening thither. <hi>MOD.</hi> I have never yet met with a man so much unconcern'd, and that has talk'd at this rate of Freedom and Liberty. <hi>BAS.</hi> Perhaps you never yet met with a true Bishop, otherwise in like Circumstances he would have treated you in the same way that I have done. For, Sir, in other things we are peculiarly submissive and humble, according to the Law of our Religion, far from proudly exalting our selves, I say, not
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:49523:182"/> against supream Authority, but any of the meanest and most Plebeian Rank. But when the Cause of God, and Religion is at stake, we overlook all things else, and fix our eyes only upon him. In such Cases, Fire and Sword, wild Beasts, and Instruments to rake off the Flesh by piece-meal, are a Pleasure rather than a Torment to us. You may therefore reproach and threaten us, do your pleasure, and use your Power; let the Emperor know you cannot conquer us, for you shall never prevail with us to confederate with that impious Sect; no, though you should threaten worse things than you have done yet.

                     <p n="2">II. THE Prefect now plainly saw, that the man's Resolution was impregnable, and though he appear'd outwardly angry, could not at the same time but entertain a secret Reverence and Veneration for him. Whereupon having dismiss'd him, he went immediately to the Emperor, and told him, Sir, we are conquered by this one Bishop, whom no Threat'nings can shake, no Arguments move, no Promises allure. Some timorous or mean Fellow may be wrought upon, but for this man, he must either be set upon by direct open force, or there can be no Expectations of his yielding. <hi>Valens</hi> had so much Generosity, as to admire Virtue in an Enemy; and though he was asham'd to desert his Party, yet he commanded all rigorous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings against him, to be staid, and sought a fair occasion to insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate himself into his good Opinion, which he attempted in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.

And when the time of Oblation was come, that according to custom he was to make his Offering (which, say some<note n="x" place="margin">Nicet. Comm. in Naz. Or. XX.</note>, were Vessels of Silver) at the holy Table, and perceiv'd that no body took it up, as not knowing whether <hi>Basil</hi> would receive it, he began to tremble, and his Legs to faulter, and he had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly fallen to the ground, if one of the Clergy that stood next him, had not caught hold of him and kept him up. After this, he
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:49523:182"/> again came into the Church, and being admitted within the Vail, into the <hi>Diaconicon</hi> or Vestry, the good Bishop discours'd to him at large concerning the Faith, which the Emperor heard with great Attention, and which <hi>Nazianzen</hi> who then stood by, professes he look'd upon as things immediately spoke from Heaven, and that he could not sufficiently admire the Wisdom and divine Philosophy of those Discourses. At this intercourse amongst others of the Emperor's Train, was present one <hi>Demosthenes</hi> (whom the two <hi>Gregories, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzen</hi> and <hi>Nyssen,</hi> elegantly call <hi>Nebuzaradan</hi>) Steward and chief Cook of the Imperial Palace, who took upon him to interrupt <hi>Basil,</hi> and contradict him in rude barbarous Language. Whereat smiling, he told the Company, <hi>we have now seen an ignorant and illiterate</hi> Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sthenes. The man thought himself affronted with the answer, and broke out into Menaces and ill words, to whom the other replied, your business is to dress Meats, and prepare Sauces, but you cannot relish divine Truths, your ears being stop'd up with the noisom Fumes and Vapors of the Kitchin. The Emperor however was not unpleas'd with the Converse he had had, the edge of his fury being for the present abated, and he had a better opinion of <hi>Basil</hi> and his Party than before.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. THE <hi>Arian</hi> Prelates that were about the Court, perceived the Emperor began to stagger, and therefore plied him with warm and importunate Councils, never giving over, till they had perswaded him to banish <hi>Basil.</hi> And so sure had they made themselves of it, that the very night was appointed, and at hand for his Transportation; the Chariot in readiness, his Friends prepared to accompany him, his Enemies every where triumphing, nothing was wanting but the Emperor's hand to the Warrant, which being brought to him to sign, he was not able to write one Syllable, the Pen breaking under his hand; he tried a second and then a third, and still had the same suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, whereat he was amaz'd, his hand shook, and a Consternation seiz'd upon his mind, and catching up the Paper, tore the Warrant in pieces. The accident we may well suppose, soon fill'd every cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with discourse, and indeed was a great Instance of Heavens im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate appearing in the good man's Cause, which wanted not at the same time, other Testimonies from Heaven for its Vindication. <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates</hi>

                        </note> the Emperor's Son was seiz'd with a malignant Feavor, which rag'd beyond all hopes of Life. <hi>Valens</hi> was infinitely afflicted with the young Princes sickness, and in token of the deepest Grief and Passion, threw himself upon the ground. Physicians of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Note are sent for, whom the Emperor intreated to improve the utmost of their skill for his Son's recovery. But all in vain, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper was not to be remov'd by Arts of Physick. The Empress <hi>Dominica</hi> was not only equally concern'd with her Husband, but had been troubled with frightful Dreams, whereby she said she had been made to understand, that this Calamity had befallen them for the injury that had been done the holy Bishop. Hereupon 'twas con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that <hi>Basil</hi> should be sent for, and desir'd to improve his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest with Heaven for the Princes health. But because the Emperor was conscious to himself, how much he had affronted him by the late Order for his Banishment, he would not directly send for him in his own name, but committed it to some great men to manage.
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:49523:183"/> Upon the first Intimation he came to Court, where the Emperor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spoke him in this manner; if the Doctrine of the Faith you profess be true, pray to God that my Child may not dye. <hi>Basil</hi> replied, if, Sir, you'll entertain the same Faith that I do, and restore Peace and Unity to the Church, doubt not but the Prince shall recover. And indeed as soon as the Bishop set his foot within the House, the Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per began somewhat to remit. But the Emperor it seems lik'd not the Terms, to whom <hi>Basil</hi> said no more but this, then God's Will be done concerning him, and went out. The Issue was, the <hi>Arian</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops are call'd for, who pray'd over, and baptiz'd the Child, and he immediately died. Warn'd by which example, <hi>Modestus</hi> the Prefect (who was at that time taken with a desperate Sickness) sent for <hi>Basil,</hi> and with tears bewail'd his carriage towards him; he told him, he was now sufficiently sensible of his Error, beseeching him to become instrumental for the recovery of his Health; which by his Prayers he regain'd, as he confess'd after upon all occasions, not ceasing to admire, and speak of him with great honor and respect. Thus God was pleas'd to buoy up the Interest and Reputation of this excellent Bishop, in the midst of his most inveterate Enemies, so that he was suffered to keep his Station, when almost all the Catholick Bishops of the <hi>East</hi> were turn'd out and banish'd. Nay, so far was <hi>Valens</hi> himself pleas'd with him, that he gave several rich Farms which he had in those Parts, for the relief of those Poor and Lame, whereof <hi>Basil</hi> took the Charge and Care. <hi>Zonaras</hi> relates<note n="z" place="margin">Annal.

                        </note> a Passage, which I deliver to the Reader purely upon his Authority, that when at the Instigation of the <hi>Arians,</hi> the Catholicks at <hi>Nice</hi> were turn'd out of their Church, they came to <hi>Basil</hi> to intreat him to intercede for them. He undertook their Cause, and went with them to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror then at <hi>Nice,</hi> to whom he address'd himself to this purpose. <q>Sir, the Determination of this Matter is to be left to God. Let the Church-doors be fast shut, and let the <hi>Arians</hi> stand without and pray to Heaven; if the Doors open to them of their own accord, let them have the Church; if they do not, let us have leave to come and put up our Prayers to God, and if they freely open to us, let it be declar'd, that by the Judgment of Heaven the Church does belong to us; but if they do not open to us, then let it be adjudg'd to them.</q> The Emperor could not decline the Proposal, and accordingly the Doors were made fast. The <hi>Arians</hi> came and pray'd a long time, but to no purpose; they being withdrawn, the Catholicks came, with S. <hi>Basil</hi> in the head of them, who had no sooner begun their Prayers, but the Bars burst asunder, and the Doors flew open, and gave free passage for the People to enter in; to the no less Joy of the one, than to the Shame and Vexation of the other Party.</p>

<pb n="241" facs="tcp:49523:183"/> Deacons in all those Churches, which the Malice of the Faction and the Fury of the Emperor had left naked and destitute. One of the first things therefore resolv'd upon in the <hi>Arian</hi> Councils, was, that he should be sent far enough out of the way. The order for his Banishment was brought to him in the Evening, which he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd the Messenger to keep secret, plainly telling him, that if it should come to the Peoples Ears, they would infallibly throw him into the River, and he had no mind to be guilty of his death. Having without any discomposure finish'd the evening Service, at night the aged Bishop, attended only with one Servant to carry his Bible and his Pillow, took Boat, and went down the River all night, till they arriv'd at <hi>Zeugma,</hi> a Town situate also upon the <hi>Euphrates.</hi> Early in the Morning the News of his departure fill'd the City with an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Lamentation, and multitudes of People taking Boat, follow'd after him to <hi>Zeugma,</hi> and with Tears besought him to go back with them, and not to expose his Flock as a prey to Wolves. But in vain; no Perswasions or Considerations could prevail. Nay, so far was he from alledging for himself, that in this Case he must obey God rather than men; that he plainly told them, the Apostles Rule must take place, which expresly commands us, <hi>to be subject to Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities and Powers,</hi> Then they presented him, some with Money, others with Cloaths, or Servants; but he only accepted so much as was barely necessary for his Journey; and having fortified their minds with Prayers and Sermons, and exhorted them to contend earnestly for the Apostolick Doctrine, set forwards towards <hi>Thrace,</hi> the place allotted for his Banishment. But that Country being at this time over-run with the <hi>Goths,</hi> he went higher, and setled himself near the River <hi>Danow,</hi> where he so-journ'd till the death of <hi>Valens,</hi> when he return'd home, and was taken up in the publick Affairs and Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Church. And coming to <hi>Dolicha</hi> a small City in <hi>Syria,</hi> a Town miserably infected with <hi>Arianism,</hi> to place an orthodox Bishop in that See, a Woman threw a Tile at him from the top of a House, which mortally broke his skull, and covered his head with a Crown of Martyrdom. Before he died he heartily forgave the Woman, and took an Oath of his Friends then about him, that they would not call her to account, nor revenge his death.

Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral wayes he studied to molest and vex him, and amongst others, took hold of this occasion. There was at <hi>Caesarea,</hi> a Widow called <hi>Vestiana</hi> (if <hi>Nyssen</hi> means the same Person) Rich, and of honorable Quality, whose Husband was lately dead. Courted she was, by one that was Assessor to the City-judge, who press'd her with such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable and importunate Addresses, that she found no better way, than to retire from her own House; and take Sanctuary in the Church, where at the Communion-Table she solemnly invok'd the divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and call'd in Heaven to her assistance. The Governor sends immediately to <hi>Basil</hi> to demand the Woman, who refus'd to deliver her up, letting him know, that the Priviledges of the Church, fenc'd
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:49523:184"/> in by Law, were Sacred, and the Honor of the holy Table not to be violated, nor could he deliver her in this Case, without betraying the Faith. The Governor storm'd at the denial, and taking no notice where she was, sent Officers to search his House, and especially his Bed-chamber, insinuating thereby a publick Suspition that the Holy man had taken her home, and kept her for his own Bed. Nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with this, he commanded <hi>Basil,</hi> as a Criminal, to be brought before him, and sitting down upon the Bench, and being swell'd with Choler and Passion, treated him with more than ordinary rudeness and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity. He commanded his Cloak to be torn off his shoulders; hold, said <hi>Basil,</hi> I'le not only put off that, but if you please, my Coat also. He told him he would cause his lean spare Carcass to be scourg'd, to which the other readily yielded; that he would tear him piece-meal with Iron Pincers; do Sir, replied <hi>Basil,</hi> by these violent Lancings you'l cure an ill-affected Liver, with which you see I am sorely trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled. The noise hereof soon spread it self over the City, with which the People being alarum'd, the whole City was presently in an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar, Persons of all Ages, Trades and Sexes, (for the very Women put on a masculine Zeal and Resolution) betaking themselves to Arms, and catching up what came next to hand, Swords, or Spears, or Stones, or Clubs, or Fire-brands, or whatever might be an Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Rage and Cruelty: They all press'd forward like a mighty Inundation, which no Banks could stop, and happy was he thought, that could get the honor to give the first blow, nothing less being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd on, than the tearing him all in pieces. The Governor was suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently startled at the News of the danger that he was in, he knew what it was to encounter with armed fury, to which he had given but too much Provocation. And now the Scene was altered, and he who lately had so storm'd and hector'd, quak'd and trembled, and his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit sunk within him. He crouch'd, and intreated, and bewail'd his miserable and calamitous Case, which had been all in vain, had not <hi>Basil</hi> himself gone out, and both by his presence and discourse charm'd and appeas'd the Multitude, thereby at once delivering himself, his Client, and his Judge.

For the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very therefore of things to this excellent Standard, he commanded them to re-inforce the ancient Canons, and in the mean time to send him a Note of the Names of the Ministers in every Parish, with an account by whom they had been brought in, and what was the course and manner of their Life; a Copy whereof they should keep for themselves; that they should call them again under Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:49523:185"/> and if found fit, continue them, if otherwise, expell them, and return them back to a Lay-Station; and for the future, use their utmost care and diligence in the trial of such Persons, but not take them in, till they had sent him an account of them. As for the other, that of mercinary Ordinations (which he tells them, he could not at first believe) he layes before them the greatness of the Crime, in some of its more horrid Aggravations, that 'twas double iniquity to cover wickedness under a pretence of Piety, 'twas to sell the holy Ghost, to barter heavenly for earthly things, and to make a gain of the Church, which had the Body and Blood of Christ committed to it; 'twas to be a Slave to that which is Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, and the Root of all Evil; to prefer a little Money before Christ, and <hi>Judas</hi>-like, to betray him again for a few Pence, who had been once crucified for the World; and that the Lands and Possessions got by such means, might too truly be styl'd an <hi>Aceldama,</hi> a Field of Blood; that they were here in more inexcusable than the Father of <hi>Simonists,</hi> having actually done, what he only attempted, who yet had that sad doom denounc'd against him, <hi>Thy Money perish with thee;</hi> that 'twas to no purpose for them to flatter themselves, that they had taken no Money <hi>before,</hi> but only <hi>after</hi> the Imposition of hands, that this was but a Trick to delude the World, and cheat their Consciences, seeing 'twas upon that account they receiv'd it, when ever they had it. That if these things were true, 'twas high time they were amended, and that they should quit this Trade, which was the very Path-way to Hell, and not dare to pollute those hands with such ungodly Gains, wherewith they were to handle the holy Mysteries: That if after this Admonition any of them should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to offend in this kind, he should be immediately banish'd all Communion at the sacred Altar, and be forc'd to seek some other place, where he might freely sell what he had unlawfully bought, the Gift of God; <hi>For that,</hi> sayes he, <hi>we have no such custom, neither the Churches of God.</hi>

And at long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, the whole space of man's Life was short, if compar'd with the Duration of that happiness, that we expected in the future State: That no Sufferings should shake their Constancy in the Faith, the Faith deriv'd from the Ancients, ratified by the Fathers at <hi>Nice,</hi>

For besides the <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Apollinarians,</hi> who had their several Bishops, and held distinct and separate Assemblies in that City, the Catholick Party was broken into a lamentable Schism, the People being divided between <hi>Meletius</hi> their ancient Bishop, and <hi>Paulinus,</hi> whom <hi>Lucifer Calaritanus</hi> had constituted there in the Reign of <hi>Julian,</hi> ever since which time the Schism had not only smoak'd, but flam'd out, each Party striving to advance its Interest, and to depress the other. The Effects whereof were sad and deplorable, a visible decay of Piety, the mutual Hatred and Animosity of Christians, the increase of Heresie, and the open Triumph of the Enemies of the Faith. <hi>Basil</hi> was infinitely troubled at these Dissentions, though he saw it necessary to espouse the <hi>Meletian</hi> Cause, on whose side 'tis plain the right lay.

THE noise of this Converse and Reconciliation was presently carried to <hi>Theodotus,</hi> who hastily catching up the Report, without ever inquiring into the true Circumstances of the Case, fell foul upon <hi>Basil,</hi> and not only invited him no longer to the Synod, but refus'd so much as to joyn at Prayers with him. <hi>Basil</hi> finding little good like to be done, departed for that time, and went home; the News of his hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Communion with <hi>Eustathius,</hi> being in the mean time scattered abroad to his disadvantage; nay, <hi>Eustathius</hi> himself disowning that he had recanted any of his Opinions, Letters to that purpose being dispers'd by him and his Friends up and down the Country, wherein were also contained very severe and disingenuous Reflections upon <hi>Basil.</hi> This awakened him to take the next opportunity of going again into <hi>Armenia,</hi> and that he might clear his Innocence before a great and venerable Person, came to <hi>Getasa,</hi> where <hi>Meletius</hi> the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Bishop of <hi>Antioch</hi> had a Grange, whereat he then resided. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Theodotus</hi> came to him, to whom he gave a naked and impartial account of what had pass'd in his converse with <hi>Eustathius;</hi> and how in all Points he had come over to him. <hi>Theodotus</hi> answered, that after <hi>Basil</hi>'s departure, <hi>Eustathius</hi> had positively denied the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or that ever he had declar'd any such consent. <hi>Basil</hi> replied, that he could not easily think so ill of the man, as to imagine he should so lightly skip from one thing to another, and deny what he had so lately done; that he who pretended so much to abhor a Lye in the common Affairs of Life, should in so important a Matter, so openly out-face a known Truth. However, he was resolv'd to put it upon this issue, he would produce and shew him the Declaration of his Faith which he had subscrib'd; if he own'd it, and still conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in that mind, he would hold Communion with him; if not, he would utterly renounce it. <hi>Meletius</hi> liked the Proposal, and upon these Terms they seem'd agreed, and <hi>Theodotus</hi> kindly invited them to <hi>Nicopolis,</hi> himself promising to conduct them afterwards part of their Journey. But when they came thither, his mind was altered, and forgetting what had so lately pass'd at <hi>Getasa,</hi> he gave fresh vent to his Passion, and contrary to the Laws both of Hospitality and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, treated him with great rudeness and contempt. Thus disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, <hi>Basil</hi> left that place, and went to <hi>Satala,</hi> where in a more peaceable way he treated with the Bishops of that Country, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated Councils with them about settling the Affairs of the Church; the People of <hi>Satala</hi> were importunate with him, that he would constitute and ordain them a Bishop. There was it seems a Quarrel between them and <hi>Cyril</hi> their Bishop, and upon some Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions they had withdrawn from him. <hi>Basil</hi> took the Matter into his Cognizance, and having enquired into the things objected, found them nothing but malicious Insinuations, as his very Enemies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd. Whereupon he made them Friends, he and his People re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning back to a mutual Communion. And hence <hi>Basil</hi> thought good to dlspatch an Advice to Count <hi>Terentius,</hi> to acquaint him with these Transactions, and let him know the Reasons, why he had not more successfully managed the Affair that had been committed to him.</p>

And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to silence this malicious Calumny, he not only takes notice of it in his Epistles at every turn, and adds a particular Explication and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement of that Article concerning the holy Ghost, but pen'd seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral distinct Tracts about it, especially that famous and elaborate Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, <hi>de Spiritu Sancto,</hi> dedicated to <hi>Amphilochius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Iconium,</hi> at whose request it was undertaken, wherein he largely and acutely handles the whole State of the Controversie, and by unquestionable Arguments, and the whole suffrage of Antiquity, refutes the frivol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Cavils and Exceptions that had been made against him. But malice is resolv'd to lay on its load, and to charge home, though not only by different, but self-contradicting evidence. We have heard him fiercely accus'd for taking away the God-head of one of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in the Trinity; and at the same time he is traduc'd<note n="h" place="margin">
                           <hi>Ep.</hi> LXXX. <hi>p.</hi> 143.</note> to have made three several Gods. For while in Confutation of the <hi>Sabellian</hi> Heresie, he asserted three distinct Hypostases or Persons in the God-head; some of his Auditors challeng'd him with affirming that there were three Gods. And though 'twas an absurd senceless Cavil, yet it spread so far amongst the People, that he was forc'd from the Pulpit to clear himself of it in a set Discourse. Thus he was set as a mark, at which his Enemies levell'd <hi>their sharp Arrows, even bitter words.</hi> And it had been well if only his Enemies had been concern'd in it,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:49523:189"/> but what was the misery of it, some of his Friends began to be tainted with the common breath, wise and good men lending an Ear to the ill things that were spoken of him. The Monks that liv'd under his Rule and Discipline, were so disturb'd with the Reports concerning him, that they were upon the Point of making an open Separation from him, whom therefore he endeavors to set right in a large Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle<note n="i" place="margin">
                           <hi>Ep.</hi> LXXIII. <hi>p.</hi> 119.</note> to them. And indeed so far had they advanc'd in their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly Proceedings, that the great <hi>Athanasius</hi> was forc'd to write to them, and with some sharpness to rebuke their irregular demeanor towards him, and the unjust and groundless Opinions they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd of him. Amongst his neighbor-Bishops, none seem'd more forward to entertain the Suggestions of his Enemies, or more deeply to resent his suppos'd Apostacy, than <hi>Athanasius</hi> of <hi>Ancyra,</hi> a good man, and a zealous Promoter of the Catholick Faith, who accus'd him to have written things to the Subversion of the Faith, or at least to have subscrib'd what others had written to that purpose, for which he spake dishonourably of him, and threatned, if not to excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate him, at least to call him to an account for it.

It had continued a place of good account in all times, and was now advanc'd (out of spite chiefly, as 'tis probable, to S. <hi>Basil</hi>) into a Metropolis by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror <hi>Valens,</hi> and a good part of the Country about it assign'd for the Province. Hereupon <hi>Anthimus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Tyana</hi> challeng'd a Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>political Power and Jurisdiction over all the Churches in the second <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> it being but fit, he said, that the Ecclesiastick Authority should be enlarg'd according to the bounds of the civil Power. <hi>Basil</hi> was sensible how great a Diminution this was to the ancient Dignity and Jurisdiction of his See, and therefore remonstrated against this intolerable Incroachment and Usurpation; that this was a Violation of settled Rights, and an affront to the holy Canons, what had the Church to do with the Alterations of the civil State, the Sword and the Spirit had different Provinces, that his Archiepiscopal Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was founded upon Custom and long Prescription, and that no man ought to <hi>remove the old Land-marks which the Fathers had set.</hi> The new Metropolitan on the other hand stickled hard to assert and secure his usurp'd Authority, he call'd Synods, which he held independant upon any other Power but his own, seiz'd the Ecclesiastical Revenues, (and amongst the rest, the Rents of S. <hi>Orestes</hi> the Martyr in Mount <hi>Taurus,</hi> which as they were conveying to <hi>Caesarea,</hi> he set upon with an armed Multitude, taking away the Mules and Carriages by force) perswaded the Presbyters of the several Parishes to own and submit to him, and where he could not bring them over, ejected them, and placed others in their room. By which means infinite Confusions did arise, and the peace of the Church was broken into scandalous Feuds and Quarrels. <hi>Basil</hi> well saw 'twas in vain to contend, little favor could he expect at Court, and as little help from the Decision of a Council, (the <hi>Arians</hi> at this time swaying all) and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd to make the best he could of a bad Bargain, and to repair the breach by erecting some new Episcopal Sees within his own Province, whereby at once he allay'd the Storm, appropriated the Church-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues of every City to the uses of its particular Bishop, and (what was above all) provided better for the necessities of the Church; for the Diocesses of that Country being at that time wide and large, by multiplying of them into a greater number, the Churches Affairs were more nearly inspected, and greater care taken of the Souls of men. While he was thus imploy'd, news came of the death of the great <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and of that severe Persecution that thereupon rag'd at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> the <hi>Arians</hi> sparing neither Age, Sex, nor Person, nor sticking at any Instances of fierceness and inhumanity. Our good Bishop heartily afflicted with their Case, wrote them a consolatory Letter<note n="p" place="margin">Ep. LXXI. p. <hi>115.</hi>
                        </note>, <q>expressing his exquisite Commiseration of their Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the consideration whereof had almost tempted him to question, whether our Lord had utterly forsaken his Church?

But weakness sensibly growing upon him, forc'd him to take his Bed. The news of his dangerous Condition ran round the City, and People every where awakened with the sence of their loss, flock'd about his House, as if by their Prayers and passionate Exclamations, they were resolv'd to arrest that Soul that was now taking its flight to Heaven, there being none of them, but were willing to have redeem'd his life with a part of their own. His Spirits were very low, but he summon'd up nature to its last Effort, and having piously discours'd a while to those that were about him, seal'd up his last breath with that divine Ejaculation, <hi>Into thine hands I commend my Spirit.</hi> What years he had attain'd to at the time of his death, is not certain. Some report him not to have exceeded XLV. But his so often mentioning his old Age, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes that beyond all exception. His Funeral was attended with a Pomp and Solemnity suitable to the Memory of so great a Person. The Corps being taken upon the shoulders of grave venerable Persons, was throng'd on all hands, some endeavored to touch but the ends of his Funeral Shrowd, others the Bier whereon he lay, or to get within the shadow of it; some strove to get near the Persons that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him, and they that could not do that, contented themselves to see him at a distance; the Streets and Portico's were all crowded as they went along, and thousands of all Ranks and Ages joyn'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, some going before, others following after as they could get along; nor was the noise less than the crowd, the People could not contain their Grief, so that the Psalms then sung, (as was the custom in those dayes at Funerals) were drown'd by the Cries and Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:49523:191"/> of the People. And herein all sorts of Persons conspir'd to make a mournful consort, <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> Strangers and Forreigners bearing a part, and striving to outvy each others resentment of this common Calamity. And indeed it prov'd a time of mourning in a sence beyond what they intended it.

We shall only therefore remark some main lines and stroaks. Considered in his natural Faculties, he was a man of a very clear and perspicacious apprehension, a nimble and ready Wit, a smart dextrous reasoning, a deep and solid Judgment. His acquir'd Abilities highly improv'd, and added an incomparable Lustre and Ornament to his natural Perfections. As he wanted no advantages of Education, so he was not wanting in Industry and Diligence to make use of them, whereby he soon became a most comprehensive Scholar, <gap reason="foreign">

He was eminent in Grammar, Rhetorick, Philosophy, Astronomy, Geometry, Arithmetick, Physick, and what not? He had riffled all the Treasures of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and search'd into the most secret Retirements of Philosophy and secular Learning, in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect <hi>Philostorgius</hi> sayes<note n="w" place="margin">Ap Suid. loc. cit.</note>, and perhaps truly, <hi>Athanasius</hi> was but a Child to him. Nor content with this, he chiefly applied himself to the knowledge of the holy Scriptures, and the Principles of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Theology, he perfectly understood all the sublime and nice Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations of those times, and knew the Subtleties and Subterfuges of the several Sects, and where to countermine and blow them up.

This made his Judgment so oft desired, and so much relied on in weighty and important Cases, this made the Heresiarchs of those times so afraid to meddle with him, choosing rather to rail at him at a distance, than to engage with him in a close dispute.</p>

His Appetites were most chast and regular, and which he had perfectly subdued to the Discipline of Mortification and self-denial. His Diet mean and small, so little that he seem'd to live without it, and to have put on before-hand the life of Angels. His Wardrobe afforded but one Coat, and a <hi>Pallium,</hi> the cold ground was his Bed, Bread and Salt his ordinary Bill of Fare, and the next Spring his Cellar, whither he retir'd to quench his thirst. But what he wanted towards himself, he made up in care towards others, in his incomparable Charity to the Poor. What Estate he had (which was not inconsiderable) he dispos'd that way, and where his own fell short, he perswaded a liberal Supply out of the Purses of the Rich, wherewith he erected and endow'd a noble Hospital without the City, whereinto he gathered all the Sick, the Lame, the diseased that were about the City, unable to help themselves, and not easily help'd by others. So that the Streets and High-wayes were no longer pestred with those lamentable Spectacles of want, anguish and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that had lately fill'd every corner. Here all necessaries were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for them, the superintendency whereof himself undertook, and that he might set a good Example to others, he stoop'd to the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Offices about them, not disdaining to kiss and embrace the worst of the Patients, at whose stench and Sores others were ready nicely to recoil and start back. By which 'tis evident how unjustly he was accus'd by some of being proud, a Weed not likely to thrive in so haras'd and mortified a soyl; his kind behavior, known Condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to all ranks of men, his equal and patient bearing<note n="e" place="margin">Vid.

                        </note> the freest Reproofs and Admonitions of his Friends, being a sufficient Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of that groundless Slander. It was no doubt the Gravity and Constancy of his Temper, and his uncourtly incompliance with some mens humors fastened that charge upon him. Nor was he of a sower and morose Disposition, in company none more pleasant and chearful, none more facetiously Witty; when he reprov'd, none did it more gently, so as neither the fierceness of the reproof made the Person in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent, nor the softness of it rendred it ineffectual. He was in short, a calm, harmless, and quiet Person; and though in his latter time, through the Iniquity of the Age he liv'd in, he became a man of Strife and Contention, yet in himself he was of an humble and peaceable Temper, kind to, and belov'd by all good men, and rever'd by his greatest Enemies.

Besides these, he has an Epistolary Discourse to <hi>Chilo</hi> his Scholar, who had quitted the ordinary Rules of the monastick Institution, and turn'd <hi>Anchoret,</hi> wherein he gives him many excellent Admonitions and Rules for that State of Life; a Letter to a Monk, and another to a devout Virgin, who had committed folly together, where in a passionate strein of Eloquence he represents the Aggravations of their Crime, and excites them to repentance. He has also three Canonical Epistles to <hi>Amphilochius</hi> of <hi>Iconium,</hi> at whose desire he drew up a body of Rules and Directions, wherein he states the Nature of the Crimes most usually incident to humane Life, and prescribes the several Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances that were fit to be undergone before Absolution, agreeably to the sence of the Ancients, and the establish'd Canons of the Church.

Five years he spent in this retirement, when going out one day to hunt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with none but his dear <hi>Chrysaphius</hi> (whom of all his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesticks he had chosen to be the constant Companion of his life) they were both brought home dead: A loss that infinitely afflicted his Mother, and fell heavy (tho she bore it with a masculine patience) upon his Sister <hi>Macrina,</hi> who loved him above all the rest.

She was Father and Master, Tutor and Guardian to him, whom she so improved by her prudent councils and instructions, that he quickly arriv'd to the utmost perfection of true Philosophy. He had parts capable of any Science, especially a <hi>genius</hi> for Mechanick Arts, which without any help he made himself Master of, beyond what others with long time and pains are wont to do. And though he attain'd not an equal accuracy and perfection in external literature with his Brothers, yet in the improvements of Virtue he was equal to them. To which end he gave up himself to a solitary and ascetic life, joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself to the retired conversation of his Mother and Sister, with whom he spent a good part of his life. He was peculiarly remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable for his Hospitality and Charity, and when in a time of great famine, multitudes that had heard of his liberal temper flocked to him into the desert, he made such plentiful provisions for them, that the place seem'd no longer to be a Wilderness, But a populous City. <hi>Basil</hi> being promoted to the Bishoprick of <hi>Caesarea,</hi> ordain'd him Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter, as afterwards he was made Bishop of <hi>Sebastea</hi> (that probably that was situate in <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> or as <hi>Stephanus</hi> according to the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in his time, in <hi>Armenia,</hi> there being several Cities of that and the like denomination, <hi>Sebaste, Sebastea, Sebastopolis</hi> in the <hi>Eastern</hi> parts) though when this was, or how long he sat, or how he discharg'd the Affairs of that See, we are wholly left in the dark.

Indeed he was admirably prepar'd for such a change by the piety of his Temper, and the purity of his Life. He was in a manner a Christian even before his coming over to Christianity: Such his strict care and government of himself, his humility and modesty, his temperance and chastity, justice and integrity, uncorruptness and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiality in all the great Offices of the Commonwealth which he had undergone. Thus dispos'd, he stood fairer for a compliance with that Religion, wherein he was told these graces would shine with a better lustre, and wherein they would receive their utmost accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and perfection. And an accident happened, which though not very considerable in it self, did yet turn the Scale. He dream'd<note n="g" place="margin">Id. ib. p. <hi>293.</hi>
                        </note> one night, what he had never done before, that he sung that passage in <hi>David</hi>'s Psalms, <hi>I was glad when they said unto me, let us go into the house of the Lord.</hi> This way of singing seem'd a little strange to him, but withall inspir'd him with a secret pleasure and delight: The good Woman was not to be taught how to improve the passage, which she explain'd and urg'd with all its advantages; she magnified the mighty kindness and condescention of Heaven, pressing him not to be wanting to his own Salvation, nor any longer to resist the call of God, but immediately to break through whatever stood in the way to hinder him. He now yielded up himself to her importunity, and that nothing might be wanting, an opportunity presented it self to crown and compleat it.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. IT happened about this time, that <hi>Leontius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Caesarea,</hi> with some other Prelates of his Province, set out in his Journey to the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and took <hi>Nazianzum</hi> in their way. To him he address'd himself, and acquainted him with his earnest desire to be made a Christian; in order whereunto he was forthwith put under the Rites preparatory to his initiation, in the management whereof the Catechist committed a mistake; for instead of making him stand up during his attendance upon the Catechetick Lecture (as was custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary for the Catechumens who were Candidates for Baptism) he kneel'd down all the while, a posture proper only to those who were to be consecrated to the Priesthood. They that were present per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the mistake, but withall look'd upon it as a good Omen of his future advancement to the Episcopal Office. Soon after he was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd by the Bishop of <hi>Nazianzum,</hi> when at his coming out of the <hi>Baptisterium,</hi> an extraordinary light and splendor was seen to shine round about him, beholden by several, who at present took no notice of it to one another, each one thinking the Vision had been commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to him alone, but especially to the Bishop it appear'd with so surprizing a brightness, that he publickly cried out, and told the
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:49523:199"/> People, that he had anointed this Person to be his Successor in that place by the immediate Designation of the holy Ghost. Which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly came to pass, for upon the Bishop's death, after some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable vacancy, he was promoted to that See. He found the place in a bad condition, and every thing strangely out of order. It had not been long erected into an Episcopal Station, his Predecessor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the first Bishop, a man indeed of an incomparable Life, but of great plainness and simplicity, destitute of those advantages, which the Bishops of those times were furnish'd with, and which the evident necessities of the Church did require.

And he found it so: for being arriv'd near <hi>Cyprus,</hi> a violent Tempest suddenly arose, which shook and toss'd the Ship at random, a thick darkness wrap'd them up, so that neither Land, nor Sea, nor Sky could be descried, and this attended with dreadful Thunder and Lightning, as frightful and amazing as the darkness that covered them. And to add yet a deeper accent, Hunger and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine conspir'd with the common Calamity, their Provisions of Water and Victuals being all lost or spoil'd, though herein seasonably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd by some <hi>Phoenician</hi> Traders, who though in the same danger, ventur'd near the Ship, and supplied that want. The Storm in the mean time encreas'd into a greater rage and fierceness, and continued several dayes, the Ship ran a drift, all the skill of the Master, or the strength of the Sea-men being vain and useless. The Case in short seem'd desperate, and no probability to escape, every man gave up himself for lost, and bitterly bewail'd his unhappy Fate, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate hazard of his life. While our <hi>Athenian</hi> Passenger was taken up with Considerations that more nearly concerned him. The ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions of death and another World, had summon'd him to a review of his past Life, and nothing so much troubled him, as the thoughts of his being unbaptiz'd, and thereby unintitled to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of the Christian State. A Reflection that made him burst out into the most passionate Sorrows, he tore his Cloaths, threw himself upon the floor, mourn'd and cried out with so loud Exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that the very Sea-men laying aside the sence of their common danger, came and sat by him, and wept with him for Company. But recollecting himself, he address'd his Prayers to Heaven, and laid before God those miraculous deliverances and Preservations he had afforded his People in the most imminent dangers, he pleaded the particular care which the Divine Goodness and Providence had here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore taken of him, that he was his by a most solemn Dedication, and that now a second time he did devote and consecrate himself to him, which he would assuredly make good, were he pleas'd at this time to deliver him. His Prayers were no sooner ended, but granted, the Tempest ceas'd, and the Ship went on securely in its right course, with this farther happy effect of so miraculous a Preservation, that all the Passengers forthwith declar'd themselves resolv'd to become Christians. And what is yet further memorable, this imminent danger at Sea, was at the same time communicated to his Parents in a Dream, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently betook themselves to Prayers and Tears for his safety; and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a little after, as soon as the abating of the Storm suffered him to indulge his rest, dream'd that he led in Triumph a certain Fury, a malignant <hi>Daemon,</hi> that had been busie to contrive and promote his ruine. Nay, one of his intimate acquaintance, a young man then with him in the Ship, did at midnight, when they were at the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est <hi>Crisis</hi> of their danger, behold his Mother <hi>Nonna</hi> coming along
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:49523:200"/> upon the Sea, and laying hold of the Ship, drawing it safe to land, which was no sooner declar'd, but the weather clear'd up, and the Tempest vanish'd. The Storm thus over, they held on their course, and passing by <hi>Rhodes,</hi> came not long after to <hi>Aegina,</hi> (where the Ship-Master liv'd) and so to <hi>Athens,</hi> where he was joyfully entertain'd, and it was soon known what he was, his great Abilities rendring him admir'd, not only by the Scholars, but the chief Professors of that place.</p>

The first thing considerable <hi>Nazianzen</hi> did after his return, was to make good what he had so solemnly vow'd, to consecrate himself to God by Baptism. This done, his next Consult was, in what course of life he should fix himself. He found himself strongly inclin'd to a solitary and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastick life, the pleasures of Retirement and Contemplation being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely grateful to him. On the other hand he was inflam'd with a desire, fully to inform himself in the knowledge of the holy Scriptures, and the divine Mysteries of the Christian Faith, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he could not hope for those advantages from a solitary Life, which he might expect from Society and Conversation. He resolv'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore upon a middle course, neither wholly to desert the World, nor yet to engage in the Business, and the bustle of it; he could reap the benefits of Contemplation at Home, as well as the devoutest Asce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick in the Wilderness, and yet at the same time (what he account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no small part of Piety) be helpful and assisting to his aged Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. He look'd upon it as a great part of that divine Philosophy he had attain'd to, to be able to promote the ends of Vertue, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of a Cell or a Monastery, desiring rather to be, than to seem Religious, it not being the place, but the Life makes the Monk. And his Father to render him more useful both to himself, and to the Church, surprized him into Ecclesiastick Orders against his will. For though he had a singular reverence for the Ministerial and Episcopal Order, yet was he resolved not to engage in it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in yet his Father over-ruled him, and ordain'd him Presbyter, which he took the more patiently, considering the necessities of the Church at that time, and how ready Hereticks were to infest the Orthodox, as he tells <hi>Basil</hi> in a Letter<note n="c" place="margin">

He lay upon the ground, fed sparingly upon the meanest diet, wore nothing but what was course and vile, he watch'd, wept, and fasted; work'd hard all day, and far'd hard at night, which he spent many times intire in Hymns or Contemplations; so far from yielding to the Courtship of any pleasure, that he suffered it not so much as to address it self unto his thoughts. Nor was he yet so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely taken up in these severe exercises of mortification, as wholly to neglect his Studies, which he daily improv'd, especially that of the holy Scriptures, which the oftner he read, the better he lik'd, so that in a short time he began to dis-relish those prophane Authors, which before time had stoln away so many of his hours, and had entertain'd him with so much delight.</p>

Thus he became Coadjutor to his Father, the cares of whose old age he reliev'd by his unwearied pains and diligence, in preaching, opposing and convincing Gainsayers, and all other parts of the Ministerial Function, though some who had been forward to recal him from his solitudes, shewed a great cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and indifferency to his Ministry, when he was come among them, whereof he complains with some resentment in an Oration<note n="o" place="margin">

How could Bishops ever hope to prevail with others, not to suffer themselves to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried down the Stream, or to keep themselves from being infected with the Superstition and Idolatry of the times, if they could not first perswade their own Children?

<pb n="286" facs="tcp:49523:205"/> upon all accounts so inconvenient for him. <hi>Basil</hi> netled with his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate refusal, treated him it seems with some severity, calling him a <hi>Rustick</hi> and a <hi>Clown,</hi> and a man that understood not his Interest, and that was resolv'd to forfeit and disoblige his Friends. The other replyed with stomach enough, that he knew not wherein he had deserv'd this usage, that 'twas hard for a man first to be abus'd, and then charg'd for complaining of it; that perhaps the best account that could be given of it, was, that his Archiepiscopal Dignity had swell'd him with pride and loftiness; otherwise, abating the eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his place, he knew not wherein he was inferior to him, a thing which he himself at all other times was forward enough to allow; that the World talk'd loud of him for this unkind attempt, and that he was weary with making Apologies to defend him from those sharp Censures, that were pass'd upon him, that those who spoke softest, said, it was not according to those strict Laws of Friendship that were between them, that 'twas an instance of great contempt and disrespect, after he had made so much use of his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance (he means I suppose, his endeavours in promoting <hi>Basil</hi> to the See of <hi>Caesarea</hi>) he should now cast him away as a dishonourable instrument, good for nothing, and deal with him like the suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of a new built Arch, which when the structure is able to stand alone, are taken down, and thrown aside as useless and unprofitable; that he beg'd of him to let him enjoy his ease and privacy, and not to reproach him with sloth and idleness, because he refus'd his offer of <hi>Sasima,</hi> and had no mind to a Bishoprick, while others were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending for them with zeal and fierceness; a quiet life being to him above all other business, wherein if he had more to follow him, the Church would have far less trouble, and the Faith, which now by every Party was made an instrument of Faction, would be preserv'd much more entire and sound: That therefore he should do well to let him alone, and not attempt to rob the new Metropolis of so glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious a prize as <hi>Sasima,</hi> and in the mean time discover (what he ought to keep secret) the unwarrantable design he had in it: That however he dispos'd his Affairs, yet as to himself, he had gain'd these two points from his Friendship, never henceforth to trust Friends, nor to esteem any thing more excellent and valuable than God. To such heats and jars may the dearest, and the firmest Friendship be sometimes expos'd.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. <hi>BASIL</hi> though meeting with all this opposition, would not however give over the attempt. His own interest failing, he knew no better way to over-power <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> than by gaining over his Father to his Party. He did so, and by his perswasions and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, he was at last prevail'd with to comply, and accordingly was ordain'd Bishop of <hi>Sasima;</hi> at what time he made an Apologetick Oration<note n="d" place="margin">

<pb n="287" facs="tcp:49523:205"/> should now put such hard things upon him; that he had indeed got the better of him, and carried the day, but 'twas not by argument, but by force; that he should prosperously go on in his pastoral Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and shew him the way both by his Precepts and Examples, whose happy conduct he was resolv'd to follow. Upon the same Argument and Occasion, and to the same Persons, (though whether at the same time, I know not) he discours'd in another Oration<note n="e" place="margin">
                           <hi>Orat.</hi> V. <hi>p.</hi> 134.</note>, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly complaining of the injury that had been done him, in drawing him out of the shades of his beloved Solitude, and thrusting him upon the Stage of a publick Life, a thing he little expected from Persons of such intimate Familiarity and Friendship. The next day came <hi>Gregory Nyssen, Basil</hi>'s Brother, (who probably should have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at the Ordination) whose arrival (it being then a Festival Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of the Martyrs) he wellcom'd with an Oration<note n="f" place="margin">

                        <note n="g" place="margin">Naz. Ep. XXX p. <hi>797.</hi>
                        </note>, under pretence indeed of making a visit to the elder <hi>Gregory,</hi> but the design was to try if he could bring over <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzen</hi> to his Party. He set upon him with all the methods of Insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, sometimes congratulating, other whiles intreating, sometimes threatning, and then expostulating; now commending, and anon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, telling him that he ought to look upon him only as his Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Superior, and upon the new Metropolis as the greatest and most honourable. <hi>Nazianzen</hi> vindicated the honor of the See of <hi>Caesarea,</hi> as the most ancient and true Metropolis of all those parts, nor could he be prevail'd with to stir one foot. So that <hi>Anthimus</hi> departed in discontent, foaming, and charging him with <hi>Basilism,</hi> or an undue partiality to <hi>Basil,</hi> alluding to the charge of the <hi>Athenian</hi> Ambassadors, who accus'd each other of <hi>Philippism,</hi> that is, of a traiterous cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence with that <hi>Macedonian</hi> Prince. After this, he summon'd him to a Synod, which the other refus'd, as an injury to the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politick Rights; then he wrote to him to intercede, that <hi>Basil</hi> and they might meet, to consult about and debate this Matter. This he embrac'd as an equitable Proposal, referring it to <hi>Basil</hi> to appoint time and place, or whether at all he would meet about it. But I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it came to nothing.

So that he could not but look upon his sending hither, as a Condemnation to a
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:49523:206"/> Prison or a Dungeon. And it highly aggravated the unkindness, that when <hi>Basil</hi> had above fifty Sees in his Province, he should pick out this, and create it on purpose for so dear a Friend. And yet after all, if he would have gone thither, he could not, for upon his refusal of Submission, his denying to desert <hi>Basil,</hi> and betray the ancient Rights of his Metropolitan; <hi>Anthimus</hi> had seiz'd upon it, so that there could be no hopes for him to reside there with any tolerable comfort, or so much as with safety to his Life.</p>

IN these Circumstances he knew not well which way to turn him, but judg'd<note n="k" place="margin">Vid. ubi supr.</note> it the best way for the present to retire, and so withdrew to an Hospital seated in a solitary place, where he pass'd his time in pious Exercises, and the strictness of a Philosophick Life. But neither here could he find any rest. His Father's commands fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd him close, who earnestly desir'd (if possible) to fix him in his Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Station at <hi>Sasima;</hi> but that being peremptorily refus'd, he press'd him to come home, and under him to take upon him the charge of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzum,</hi> his great years having disabled him, and in the judgment of all given him a Writ of ease. He knew he had a Temper to deal with, mightily averse to the Incumbrances of a publick Life, and therefore recommended the motion to him, with all the Arts of endearment and soft Insinuation. Taking him gently by the Beard, <q>Son, said he, your own Father is become your Petitioner, an aged Father to a youthful Son; a Master to one that is a Servant by Nature and a double Obligation. 'Tis not Riches, or great things I ask, I require no more than that like <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Samuel</hi> you would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to minister before the Lord. Despise not the desires of him, who was the Instrument of your being, and let it appear you have an indulgent Father; the thing I request is fair and reasonable, and though it were not, yet remember 'tis your Father requests it, one who has spent so great part of his Life in the Ministeries of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Gratifie me therefore in this, or else I vow that some body else shall close mine eyes, and commit my body to the ground, which I intend to inflict as the punishment of your disobedience. 'Tis but a little time that I have to live, assist me in it, and then I shall leave you to your own Counsels.</q> To this pathetical address <hi>Nazianzen</hi> replied, <q>Sir, how troublesome soever the commands are which you are pleas'd to lay upon me, yet for your sake I submit, and I am content to take upon me the Administration of your cure at <hi>Nazianzum,</hi> only upon this condition, that when ever you shall be translated into Heaven, I may be perfectly free from all obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that charge.</q> Upon these Terms they agreed, and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came his Co-adjutor in the Episcopal Office.

                           <hi>Orat.</hi> VIII. <hi>p.</hi> 145</note>, wherein he addresses himself first to his Father, with whom he expostulates why he had made choice of so weak a

His body though infirm and weak, was yet acted by a Soul brisk and vigorous, and now wholly free from the inordinate Motions of the sensual appetite; that it concern'd him however to have made such a choice, wherein he might not seem to have been led more by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations of Consanguinity and Relation, than the common Good. Next he turns to the People, whom he acquaints with the force that had been us'd towards him, and how much he had yielded to the Age of his Father, and the importunity of his Friends, and therefore begg'd their assistance according to their several capacities; that he was distracted between two different Principles; his inclination to so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude made him cast an eye to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </note> of it he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected his discourse to his Mother <hi>Nonna,</hi> to support her mind under so great a loss; that she was not to wonder at what had happened, all things in this World are obnoxious to change and mutability, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to decay and dye, the happiness of the other World only being immutable and eternal, to provide for which, is the great business of life, and that therefore there could be no reason to mourn for those that had made so happy an exchange, unless we can be so uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as to rob another of his happiness, meerly for our own conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency; if the burden was heavy, 'twas but a little way she had to bear it, she her self being like shortly to follow after; and though they were great comforts she had lost, yet it was to be remembred how long she had enjoy'd them; that it was but fit she should submit to what was best; and she who with so much wisdom and courage had borne the death of her Children in their most flourishing years, ought
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:49523:208"/> much more to bear the fall of a tottering Carcase, quite worn out with age and weakness. And indeed the Consolations were proper and seasonable; for the good Woman thus depriv'd of the main Staff of her Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Those little arts of fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and bravery, whereof other Women are so much enamoured, she slighted, accounting the truest beauty to lye in a divine temper of mind, and no Nobility to be comparable to the Virtues of a good life. She carefully administred the Affairs of her Family, as if she had had nothing else to mind, and yet attended the duties of Religion, as if that alone had been her business. The Ministers of Religion she was wont to entertain with a profound reverence, beholding them as the Messengers of Heaven, and Stewards of holy things: Her time she spent in Fasting, and Watching, in Prayers, and sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Psalms day and night; in the publick Congregation she was taken up with silent admirations, and her Soul possess'd with so awful a reverence of the Majesty of those Divine Solemnities, that she would never turn her back upon the holy Table, nor spit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Pavement of that place, where God was so devoutly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship'd, she shunn'd the Converse of the <hi>Gentile</hi>-Ladies, even those of them that were neerly related to her, whom she would not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute with the ordinary expressions of Familiarity, nor eat with those that defil d themselves with Pagan Idolatrous Worship. In the midst of those many and severe troubles that came upon her, she main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd an even temper of mind, whatever Accident befel her, praise was always the first word in her mouth; not a tear in her eye, nor a mourning Habit to be seen upon her upon any of the Churches Festivals. And yet at the same time, none more compassionate of the miseries of others, and more ready to assist them, singularly kind to her indigent Relations, and no less charitable to the poor, a publick Guardian to Widows and Orphans, to provide for whose necessities she reckoned was the only true and durable Riches, and the best way at once to secure and improve an Estate.</p>

The rage and the clamour was great against him, but he comforted himself at that instant to remember,<note n="i" place="margin">

                     <p n="6">VI.

The <hi>Arians,</hi> notwithstanding the death of <hi>Valens,</hi> and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict he had publish'd for permitting the Orthodox Bishops to return to their Sees, yet finding no restraint laid upon them, still openly plaid their Game, and offered all manner of affronts and indignities to the Catholicks: Insomuch, that <hi>Eusebius</hi> the venerable Bishop of <hi>Samosata</hi> in his return from Banishment, was knock'd on the head at <hi>Dolicha</hi> with a Tile thrown by a Woman from the top of a House as he pass'd along the Streets. But their great spite was at <hi>Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen,</hi> whom not daring to attempt by open force, they labour'd to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Reputation, and because Malice it self was not able to object any thing material, they pelted him with little trifling Cavils, as, that he was born in a poor and obscure place, descended of mean and ignoble Parents, that he was of a rude uncourtly temper, blunt of speech, and of an austere and unpleasant Conversation, as there were others that charg'd him with a too tame and easie disposition, that let things run which way they pleas'd. These were things that weigh'd little with wise men, but they were the best they had to object. However, not to be wanting to himself especially at this time, he wip'd off these aspersions in a publick Oration<note n="b" place="margin">
                           <hi>Or.</hi> XXV. <hi>p.</hi> 431.</note>, wherein he more particularly address'd himself to the <hi>Arian</hi> Party. <q>As for the mean place of his Nativity he tells<note n="c" place="margin">Ibid. p. <hi>435.</hi> &amp;c.</note> them, it might be his unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, but not his fault. No man accuses the Dolphin that he is not a Land-animal, or the Ox, that he does not live in the Water. Must he be run down, because he did not build the place of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, and furnish it with such splendid ornaments of Walls, The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aters, <hi>Circ's,</hi> Palaces, <hi>Portico</hi>'s, <hi>Forums,</hi> such a frequent Populacy, and a noble Senate, as they had at <hi>Constantinople.</hi> He was poor, he granted, and had no Estate or Revenues, kept no sumptuous Table, nor wore costly Garments; things which he did not think reasonable to make the matter of his glory. If he was born in an obscure corner, so was <hi>Samuel,</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Moses,</hi>
                           <pb n="300" facs="tcp:49523:212"/> and other great Worthies upon Record in Scripture: Was he a stranger and Forreigner? So was <hi>Abraham,</hi> so were the Apostles, when they were sent to convert the World. As for his Birth and Extract, they mistook the true notion of Nobility; all men with respect to this lower World, are descended of the same mean Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, the true Countrey and Kindred of great and good men is the <hi>Jerusalem that is above;</hi> 'tis the Soul polish'd by Vertue, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd into the Divine likeness, that challenges the true Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; which he that defaces and defiles by sin, and superinduces the Image of the Serpent, that's the man that's base-born and vile, Civil Dignities and Distinctions are but the Scenes and Phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick Pageantries of this frail transient Life; things that may be gain'd by money, and lost by poverty, denied or granted at the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Prince. In these things you may pride your selves, and boast of the Stories, and the Tombs and the Monuments of your Ancestors; my study is to purifie my self from all fraud and vice, the only way, either to preserve, or to regain Nobility. The morose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and rusticity which they objected, and his avoiding the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and intercourses of common Conversation, was not pride or an affected singularity, but a serious retiring within himself, to take the more frequent and impartial Account of himself, and his own actions. That they had made mildness and moderation<note n="d" place="margin">Ibid. p. <hi>439.</hi>
                           </note> a part of his Crimes, and had charg'd it upon him as a piece of mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and folly, he thank'd them for it; for what was all this to what Christ had suffered? And yet his whole life and death was fill'd with nothing more than instances of meekness and tenderness, of mercy and forgiveness. And if he who was God, scrupled not to do, and to undergo so much, and to lay down his Life for us, shall we think much to forgive a few petty Injuries and Offences to our fellow-creatures? And indeed, that such had been his own carriage among them, he solemnly appeals to themselves, tacitly reproaching them with their own cruel severities.

                        </note> with great kindness and humanity, and among other things told him, that God had sent him to give him Possession of the Church, which he was ready to deliver up into his hands, as the reward of his labors. But the <hi>Arians,</hi> however pretending to submission, were yet resolv'd not so tamely to part with their hold. They fill'd all places with peevish and passionate Complaints, the Emperor they plied with Petitions, as on the other hand they vomited out nothing but Exclamations and Threatnings against <hi>Nazianzen</hi> and his Party, and to make good their words, had prepar'd an armed multitude to
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:49523:214"/> make resistance. So that the next day, which was to be the Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Installment, the Emperor was forc'd with a strong Military Guard to conduct the poor Bishop through the Streets, which were not only beset with Enemies design'd either by publick Tumults, or private Assassinations to do mischief, but crowded with multitudes of Spectators on every side. As they pass'd along to the Church, a black Cloud suddenly arose, which wrap'd them up all in darkness, and threatned them instantly with a most dreadful Storm. This the <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> presently caught hold of, and cried out, 'twas a miraculous Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony from Heaven against the Proceedings of that day, and indeed it struck no little damp and terror into the Catholicks. But no sooner were they got within the Church, and the Emperor and the Bishop entred into the Quire, and an Hymn begun to the praise of the great Creator, but in a moment the Cloud dissipated, and the Sun burst out with so amazing a brightness, that few were able to behold it, which greatly animated the Catholick, and confuted the foolish and presumptious Presages of the <hi>Arian</hi> Party. And now the cry was from all parts of the Church. and from all sorts of Persons, beseeching the Emperor, as the greatest kindness he could do the City, to place <hi>Nazianzen</hi> on the Episcopal Throne. The good man partly through weakness and infirmity, and partly through affirightment (a despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Fellow having drawn his Sword at him, though immediately forc'd to put it up again) was not able, as at other times, to make an Oration to the People, and therefore commanded one of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to stand up, and modestly acquaint them in his name, that he desir'd them to surcease their Suit, that this was a day of Thanksgiving, and to be intirely devoted to the praise of that God who had heap'd such Blessings upon them, and that what was of further concernment, should be transacted in due time and place.</p>

He spent his time in Prayer and Fasting, in Preaching and visiting the Sick, retiring sometimes out of the City, partly to repair his health, and partly to enjoy the advantages of solitude. The Revenues of his Church, though very large, he never medled with; and albeit he had fair opportunities thence to have enrich'd himself, he took not one penny of it to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease his private Estate, but committed the management of it wholly to the Stewards and Treasurers of the Church, not so much as taking an account of the Plate that belonged to it. His thoughts were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd about higher and better things, and his time and strength so intirely swallowed up with the Cares and Troubles of his Charge, that his body could bear up no longer. Sickness confin'd him to his Bed, and that presented him with an opportunity of exercising an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the greatest Charity. It happened that great numbers of People highly satisfied with what had lately pass'd, crowded into his Room, to pay in his presence their acknowledgments to Almighty
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:49523:214"/> God for so great Mercies, and to pray for the health and prosperity of the Emperor, and withall to pay their thanks to him, whom they own'd to have been the Instrument that procur'd these Blessings; which done, they departed. The rest being gone, there staid behind a young man with a pale look, long hair, in squalid and tatter'd Cloaths, who standing at the Beds feet, made all the dumb signs of the bitterest Sorrow and Lamentation. <hi>Nazianzen</hi> startled a little at the man and his behavior, asked him who he was, whence he came, and what he wanted? To which he returned no answer, but express'd so much the greater Passion and Resentment, howling, wringing his hands, and beating his breast, insomuch that the Bishop himself was mov'd to tears. Being at length pluck'd from that place by force, one who stood by told the Bishop; <hi>This, Sir, is the Assassinate, whom some had suborn'd to murder you, and had effectually done it, had not the divine Providence interpos'd to hinder him; for this his Conscience has fallen foul upon him, and he's here come ingenuously to confess his fault, and to beg your Pardon.</hi> Whereto the good Bishop replied, <hi>Friend, God Almighty be propitious to you, his gracious Preservation of me obliges me freely to forgive you; the desperate attempt you designed has made you mine; nor do I require any other reparation, than that henceforth you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert your Party, and sincerely give up your self to God.</hi> The news of this accident being spread abroad, mightily advanc'd his Reputation, and rendred him dearer to the City than he was before.</p>

In opposition to other Sects that dissented from him, he baptiz'd those whom he Proselyted to his Party in a way by himself, using only single Immersion (because he said, he baptiz'd into Christ's death, which he underwent for us, not twice or thrice, but once only) and turning the Heads of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to the bottom of the Water, with their Heels mounted up into the Air.

                        <hi>Valesius</hi> his conjecture is not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that by Patriarchs <hi>Socrates</hi> means some persons peculiarly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, if not by the Synod, at least by the Emperor, to exercise for the present an extraordinary Ecclesiastick power within those seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Dioceses, for the setling of Affairs of late much disturb'd and out of order. Thus besides <hi>Nectarius</hi> of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> who had <hi>Thrace,</hi> and <hi>Timotheus</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> who had <hi>Aegypt,</hi> the Patriarchate of the <hi>Pontican</hi> Diocess (says <hi>Socrates</hi>) was committed to <hi>Helladius</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Caesarea, Basil</hi>'s Successor, <hi>Gregory Nyssen,</hi> and <hi>Otreius</hi> of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letina</hi> in <hi>Armenia;</hi> that of <hi>Asiana</hi> to <hi>Amphilochius</hi> of <hi>Iconium,</hi> and <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timus</hi> of <hi>Antioch</hi> in <hi>Pisidia;</hi> that of the <hi>Eastern</hi> Diocess to <hi>Pelagius</hi> of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> and to <hi>Diodorus</hi> of <hi>Tarsus:</hi> where we may observe, that he of <hi>Antioch,</hi> though the first Bishop of that Diocess, is not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, probably because <hi>Meletius</hi> Bishop of that See was newly dead, and though <hi>Flavian</hi> was immediately thrust up into his Room, yet his election was hotly disputed and contested; upon which account 'tis like the Emperor forbore to nominate him in the Constitution which he publish'd about this matter. However, that the See might not suffer any prejudice, both the Emperor and the Canon make particular provision, that the Rights and Priviledges granted to the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> by the Canons of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> should be reserved intire.

This will be beyond all Dispute; if we consider, that upon the passing this Canon, and the rising of the Council, <hi>Theodosius</hi> put out an Imperial Edict,<note n="e" place="margin">C. Th. lib. <hi>16.</hi> Tit. <hi>1.</hi> l. <hi>3.</hi> p. <hi>9.</hi>
                        </note> commanding the Churches in these several Dioceses to be delivered to as many as confest the true Faith of the holy Trinity, and held Communion with the Persons above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned. The truth is, this matter has been not a little obscur'd by <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Sozomen,</hi> who 'tis plain, have confounded the Canon and the Law of <hi>Theodosius,</hi> and patch'd up one out of both, when as they were widely different. The Canon is General, and states the constant bounds of those <hi>Eastern</hi> Jurisdictions, that each of those five divisions should be of equal extent with the Civil Diocess, and that the Bishops of one Diocess, should not ordinarily intermeddle in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Edict which was grounded upon, and publish'd immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after the Canon, was particular, and only temporary, nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting what Persons within those five Dioceses should manage and transact Church-affairs, for the present greatly out of order, and judge who were fit after so many disturbances and irregularities as had late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly over-run the Church to be admitted to Communion. This being done, that Edict was of no more force; and is therefore omitted in the <hi>Code</hi> of <hi>Justinian,</hi> the Power it convey'd being personal, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly long since expir'd. In short, whatever becomes of the Patriarchal Controversie, whereof more perhaps in another place, the meaning of the Canon is evidently this, that those five Dioceses should be the ordinary division of the <hi>Eastern</hi> Churches, and that the Bishops of one Diocess should not interfere with, nor ordain, or exercise any act of Authority and Jurisdiction in another, and that this being observ'd, the Affairs of every Province should be decided by the Synod of that Province, according to the <hi>Nicene</hi> Constitutions. And 'twas but time to provide for this, there having been of late some uncanonical proceedings; thus <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> took upon him by the three Bishops he sent to ordain <hi>Maximus</hi> of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> as <hi>Meletius</hi> of <hi>Antioch</hi> and some others to translate <hi>Nazianzen</hi> to the same See.</p>

And as in the first Ages of Christianity, scarce any thing more advanc'd the <hi>Grandeur</hi> and <hi>Reputation</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> than its being the Seat of the Empire, which Priviledges being granted by the Fathers upon that account (as they of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> expresly affirm) so they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd it but reasonable, that <hi>Constantinople</hi> being now made the Seat of the Imperial Throne, the Church there should bear some propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the dignity of the Civil State, and the Bishops enjoy as much Priviledge as they did at <hi>Rome.</hi> And indeed the best way to let in light, both upon this and the preceding Canon, and to find what Priviledges were granted to the See of <hi>Constantinople</hi> by this Canon, as also by that of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> and some following Councils, were to enquire what Precedence and Power the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishops anciently had, and what they usurp'd.

                        </note> the good Bishop of <hi>Antioch</hi> died during the sitting of the Council, whose Funeral (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Person of his Age and Merits) was attended with an universal confluence of the City, and on several dayes honour'd with Orations by the most eloquent Persons in the Council. And now great Heats arose among them about choosing a Successor in his room, a strong Party being made for <hi>Flavianus</hi> Presbyter of <hi>Antioch,</hi> for whom at last they carried it. <hi>Nazianzen</hi> hoping to reconcile the Differences, propounded a pious and peaceable Expedient, (though his appearing in it, and thereby seeming to espouse the Cause of the <hi>Western</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, as was that of <hi>Paulinus</hi> against them of the <hi>East,</hi> conjur'd up a Spirit, which all his Art and Interest could not lay, the opposite Party in the Synod fermenting into Heat and Passion, who hence took oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to fall upon him, till nothing would satisfie them, but the throwing up his place; he propounded) that <hi>Paulinus,</hi> whom <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Calaritanus</hi> had ordain'd Bishop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> might continue so for the short remainder of his Life, after whose death (which could not be far off) all Competitions ceasing, they might then choose whom they pleas'd, and so a Period be put to the unhappy long-continued Schism of that Church. He told them further, that as to himself, he had unwillingly entred upon the See of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and though he had spent, and that not unsuccessfully, infinite pains and labours in that place, yet he expected no other reward but from above; that after the Importunities of the People, and their own free Votes had forc'd the thing upon him, it seemed strange that any of them should go about to undoe their own Act, and endeavor to supplant and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine him; not that he cared for Riches or Honor, or prided himself
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:49523:222"/> in the Title of Bishop of the imperial City, but that he had a tender regard to the necessities of the People, and that it must needs east an Imputation either of envy or levity upon themselves to run coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to their own late Determinations. However if they had a mind to take that course, he was ready freely to resign his Bishoprick; they might consult and resolve upon what they pleas'd, solitude had never been unwelcome to him, and 'twas his comfort, that though they might separate him from his See, they could never part between him and God. Having ended his Speech, he perceiv'd the Faction to grow strong against him, and the Ancients ready▪ to side with the younger and more heady part of the Council; so he left them, and retir'd to a remote part of the City, purposely to avoid the noise and croud. But no sooner what had pass'd was rumour'd abroad, but a croud of People throng'd about him, and passionately besought him to pity the miserable Flock, which with so much care and pains he had hither fed and govern'd. What, would he now throw up the Crop which he had sown, and had brought from so small a handful, to so much maturity and plenty? To whom would he leave his Sheep? He had hitherto spent his strength amongst them, let him give God and them the remainder of his Life, and lay his bones amongst them. He could not but be greatly affected with their Prayers and Tears, yet suffered not himself to be mov'd from his Resolution, which he every day found more reason to put into Execution.</p>

These courses therefore not succeeding, he resolv'd to be no longer a bone of Contention, and to that end went straight to Court, where upon his knees kissing the Emperor's hand, he told him; <q>I am come, Sir, to beg a request of you, not Riches or Treasure for my self, or eostly Ornaments for the Church, or Honors or Offices for my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations; these are little things fit for narrow and contracted minds, they are greater Matters I design for my self; this only I beg, that I may have leave to be gone, and to give way to the envious and ill-minded; if I like Bishopricks any where, 'tis a great way off; here I disgust my very Friends, only because I value nothing but God; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you, amongst all the Trophies and Triumphs of your Reign, let this be the greatest, your reducing them to Unity and Concord, whom if the fear of God will not, let your Authority compel them to lay down their Arms; this is the last request of him, whom your Majesty knows you plac'd against his will upon this Episcopal Throne.</q> The Emperor and those that stood by, admir'd the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the man, and was at last drawn, not without some difficulty, to consent to his Petition; whose leave being obtain'd, he had now nothing to do, but to take his farewel.

The Catholick Bishops were greatly troubled at this liberty indulg'd to Hereticks, not knowing how far those subtle Agents might work upon the good nature of the Emperor.

The Bishop replied, the honor he had given him was enough. Whereat the Emperor began to storm, and told him he look'd upon a contempt done to his Son, as offered to himself. <hi>You see then, Sir,</hi> (replied the Bishop) <hi>how little you can bear an affront offered to your Son, and how angry you are with them that do it; think now with your self, and be assur'd, that God the great King of the World, does much more resent and detest th s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

However that things might be carried in the fairest manner, the Synod met in <hi>June Ann.</hi> CCCLXXXIII. But the Emperor having altered his Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of having things canvass'd in a way of publick Disputation, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Principals of every Sect to present an account of their Faith in writing, which they did accordingly. These being brought in, he took the Papers, and retiring into his Closet, earnestly beg'd of God his assistance and direction in the search of Truth. This done, he read over the several Confessions, and only approv'd and set his Seal to that which contain'd the <hi>Consubstantial</hi> Doctrine, the rest he tore in pieces, the Authors of them returning home with shame and sorrow. All which <hi>Theodosius</hi> a few dayes after ratified by two very strict Constitutions<note n="k" place="margin">

<pb n="329" facs="tcp:49523:226"/> necessity, and was to him a most welcome and happy opportunity, wherein he took as great a pleasure, as a man that has been toss'd in a long storm at Sea, does in a safe and a quiet harbour. And indeed being now freed from all external cares and troubles, he intirely gave up himself to solitude and Contemplation, and to the exercises of a strict and devout life.

Indeed his frequent Infirmities (for though naturally of an healthful Constitution, hard Study, and an over-rigid abstinence had greatly impair'd his health, and subjected him to many severe Distempers, whereof he complains at every turn, especially in his Epistles, these, I say) had kept awake in him a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant sence of his Mortality, and he entertain'd every Sickness as a Messenger of death. He had some years since made his Will, a Copy whereof is still extant, said in the Title to have been transcribed from the Original, subscrib'd with his, and the Witnesses own hands.

For I have now declar'd my mind, and have consecrated my whole Estate to the Catholick Church at <hi>Nazianzum,</hi> for the relief of the Poor belonging to the said Church. For which purpose, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this determination, I have appointed three Over-seers for the Poor, <hi>Marcellus</hi> Deacon and Monk, <hi>Gregory</hi> the Deacon, and <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stathius</hi> the Monk, who both of them were of my Family. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving still the same affection towards the holy Church of <hi>Nazianzum,</hi> I continue in the same purpose and Resolution. Whensoever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I shall happen to depart this life, let the abovesaid <hi>Gregory</hi> Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con and Monk, who was of my Family, and whom heretofore I ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numitted, be Heir to all my Estate movable and immovable, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever it be (all other Heirs I renounce) upon condition, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store my whole Estate, movable and immovable to the holy Catholick Church of <hi>Nazianzum,</hi> deducting nothing, but what in this my Will either by way of trust, or Legacy I have privately bequeath'd to some few Persons; but that all the rest be intireiy reserv'd to the said Church,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:49523:227"/> as becomes one that has the fear of God before his eyes, and knows that I have ordain'd and dispos'd my whole Estate to the use of the Poor of that Church, and have appointed him Heir for this very end, that by his means it may be kept safe and without fraud for the Church aforesaid.</p>
                                 <p>The Servants whom I have manumitted either out of my own good will, or according to the command of my Parents of blessed me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, my will is, that they shall still enjoy their freedom, and all their own proper Goods without disturbance or molestation.</p>

As for the breed-Mares, and the Sheep, which when I was there, I commanded to be delivered to them, the full and absolute disposal whereof, I committed to them; I Will that they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy them undisturbed by the right of Lordship and Dominion. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over it is especially my Will, that <hi>Gregory</hi> the Deacon, and my Heir, who has so faithfully ministred to me, shall by a peculiar right of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion have fifty pieces of Gold.</p>

And whereas hitherto I could determine nothing concerning her Habitation, not knowing in what place she had most mind to settle; now my Will is, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever she shall choose, an House be provided for her, suitable to her quality, and to the modest and honest Conversation of a Virgin, which she shall have to her use without any molestation during her life, but after her decease it shall return to the Church.

                                 <p>I Will that the Purchase of the Farm at <hi>Canotala</hi> be delivered up to my Son the most reverend Bishop <hi>Amphilochius.</hi> For it appears from my Papers, and 'tis what every one knows, that the Contract was discharg'd, and that I receiv'd the Money, and long since gave him up the Propriety and right of Possession.</p>

But that I may not leave him without some small Testimony of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect and love, my Will is, that he have given him one Friez Coat, one Tunick, two Cloaks, and thirty pieces of Gold. <hi>Item,</hi> I give to our dear Brother and Fellow-Deacon <hi>Theodulus,</hi> one course Friez Garment, two of our Country-Coats, and twenty pieces of Gold ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rate of our own Country. <hi>Item,</hi> Tu <hi>Elaphius</hi> the Notary, a good man, and who while he attended my service, was very diligent and useful to me, I bequeath one Friez Garment, two Coats, three Cloaks, one single unlin'd Garment, and twenty pieces of Gold of the Money of our own Country.</p>

THIS Will (as appears from the date of the Consuls, and some other passages in the Instrument it self) was made not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Resignation of the See of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> probably upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of that weak sickly condition he was then in. Though whether the Month mentioned in the date be not mistaken, and <hi>January</hi> put for <hi>June,</hi> we have before observ'd cause enough to suspect, and indeed to conclude in the Affirmative.

He was in a great measure bald, what hair he had being Milk-white.

Whereof in the last place we proceed to present the Reader with this following account.</p>

The Relation of it by S. <hi>Jerom.</hi> Imputations of <hi>Arianism</hi> unjustly charg'd upon him. Clear'd by <hi>Theodorit</hi> and the Synod at <hi>Constantinople.</hi> Another <hi>Cyril</hi> in those dayes Bishop of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> mistaken for ours. What contributed to the mistake. The time of his entrance upon that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprick. The miraculous appearance of the sign of the Cross in the Heavens stretching over <hi>Jerusalem. Cyrils</hi> Letter to the Emperor, giving an Account of that Apparition. Some Remarks upon that Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. His quarrel with <hi>Acacius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Caesarea,</hi> about the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politick Rights. The great Reputation of the Church of <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> Recriminations passing between <hi>Cyril</hi> and <hi>Acacius.

The different Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts given of this matter represented. A Reconciliation of Writers in this Case impossible. <hi>Cyril</hi> mortally hated and undermin'd by <hi>Euty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius.</hi> The <hi>Arian</hi> intruders wholly omitted by <hi>Theodorit. Cyril</hi>'s Anti-remonstrance to <hi>Acacius</hi>'s Sentence, and Appeal to the Emperor. His retirement to <hi>Sylvanus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Tarsus,</hi> and constant Preaching there. His appearing at the Synod at <hi>Seleucia,</hi> and referring his Cause to the Judgment of that Council. His refusal to withdraw out of the Synod as a Person depos'd. Acquitted and restor'd by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. <hi>Acacius</hi> his Complaint against him to the Emperor. The Crimes charg'd upon him, and aggravated by <hi>Acacius.</hi> He is again depos'd, and banish'd. His return to the See under the reign of <hi>Julian. Julian</hi>'s great kindness and favour to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and resolution to repair their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and restore their Worship, upon what account. His Letter to them to that purpose. His Conference with their Chiefs about this matter. What he propounded to himself in this design. Preparations made for the undertaking. Expences allow'd, and Overseers appointed by the Emperor. The Vanity of this attempt declar'd to them by <hi>Cyril.</hi> Their endeavours in building frustrated by extraordinary storms, earthquakes, and fire from Heaven. Black Crosses impress'd upon the Cloaths of the <hi>Jews.</hi> Many converted by these miraculous appearances and attestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The <hi>Jews</hi> finding S. <hi>John</hi>'s Gospel in a Cave at the clearing the Foundations reported by <hi>Philostorgius.</hi> The truth of the other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars abundantly attested. <hi>Julian</hi>'s Command for the building an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phitheater at <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> The elegant reflections which S. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> makes upon this disappointment of the <hi>Jews.

Gelasius</hi> who. <hi>Cyril</hi>'s presiding with others in the second General Council. His publick Vindication by the Testimony of that Synod. The time of his death. The description of his Person. His Character. The Catechetick Lectures his only remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing works. The genuineness of them unjustly question'd. Some excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions against them considered. Abatements to be made for the plainness and rawness of them, and the unaccuracy of some Expressions. The main design of them to explain the Creed. What that Creed was then us'd in the Church of <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> His writings.</p>

Such among others has been the Portion of this excellent Bishop, concerning whom the Records of the ancient Church have preserv'd few memorable Passages, and a great part of those too so intricate and confus'd, that I should not have thought it worth either my Pains, or the Readers Patience, to pick them up, had I not hop'd by colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the scattered parcels of his Story to reflect some light upon them, and to free his Name from some gross Imputations, which ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance or mistake have laid upon it. Who his Parents were, or what his Country is not known, though there can be no incongruity to suppose him born in <hi>Palestine,</hi> and perhaps at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> which I find positively asserted by a late Writer<note n="a" place="margin">Alegr. de vir. illustr. O. Carme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lit. ad An. <hi>386.</hi> p. <hi>180.</hi>
                     </note>, led thereunto, I believe, by no other Authority than bare conjecture. The first time we meet with him is under <hi>Macarius,</hi> the venerable Bishop of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> a man of prime note in the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> highly honoured by <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> and particularly imploy'd by him in his magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent structures at <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> By him <hi>Cyril</hi> is said<note n="b" place="margin">Soz. l. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>20.</hi> p. <hi>570.</hi> vid.

                     </note> to have received his first Ordination, that is, probably, to the Office of a Deacon; though I must confess, the passage in <hi>Sozomen</hi> (as now extant in the <hi>Greek</hi>) as 'tis miserably transpos'd, so being tolerably restor'd, seems more naturally to refer to <hi>Maximus</hi>'s than <hi>Cyril</hi>'s Ordination. <hi>Maca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> dying, <hi>Maximus</hi> succeeded in that See about the year CCCXXXI. A man of great Name, and deserv'd reputation, having been a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor<note n="c" place="margin">Theod. l <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>27.</hi> p. <hi>109.</hi>
                     </note> under the <hi>Maximian</hi> Persecution, where, according to the cruel usage of those times, he had lost his right eye, and been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled in his right leg, the Nerves of it being cut asunder. Nor was he a more resolute defender of the Christian Faith against the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, than he was of the Catholick truth against the <hi>Arians,</hi> for which he was not a little malign'd, and oppos'd by that busie and potent Faction. By him <hi>Cyril</hi> was ordain'd Presbyter<note n="d" place="margin">Hieron. Chr. ad An. Chr. <hi>CCCXLIX.</hi>
                     </note>, and under him he exercis'd the Office of <hi>Catechist</hi> in that Church: A place of great trust, and which he discharg'd with answerable care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, preaching, in <hi>Lent</hi> especially, almost every day. And here it was, that he read those <hi>Catechetick</hi> Lectures of his that are still ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, which S. <hi>Jerom</hi> says<note n="e" place="margin">De script. in Cyril.</note> he compos'd in his younger years, and though he tells us not the just time, yet <hi>Cyril</hi> himself gives us an hint, by which we may make a very near Conjecture. For speaking<note n="f" place="margin">Cyr. Catech. <hi>VI.</hi> p. <hi>141.</hi>
                     </note> concerning the rise of the <hi>Manichean</hi> Heresie, he says, it began just LXX. years before, under the Reign of <hi>Probus,</hi> and that there were some then alive, who had seen the Heretick. Now supposing, what <hi>Eusebius</hi>
                     <note n="g" place="margin">Chron. ad An. MMCCXCIII.</note> plainly asserts, and justifies by the concurrent Computati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the several <hi>Eastern Epocha</hi>'s, that <hi>Manes</hi> began to broach his Heresie in the second year of the Emperor <hi>Probus,</hi> that is, <hi>Ann. Chr.</hi> CCLXXVII. the LXX. years will fall in exactly with <hi>Ann.</hi> CCCXLVII. at what time he preach'd those Lectures to the <hi>Catechumens.</hi>

                     <pb n="342" facs="tcp:49523:233"/>II. THIS Exercise he, probably, continued till his Promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Bishoprick, which hapned about three years after, upon <hi>Maximus</hi>'s being depos'd by the <hi>Arians,</hi> as some say; upon his death, say others, and perhaps more truly. And here we must encounter with the most perplex'd and intricate part of his story, I mean his succession to that See, together with the several vicissitudes and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations that depend upon it, so brokenly and imperfectly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented by the Writers of that, and the following age, that little cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty can be pick'd up about it. The Account is confusedly hinted by others, but most consistently delivered by S. <hi>Jerom</hi>
                     <note n="h" place="margin">Chron. ubi su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra.</note> to this effect; that upon <hi>Maximus</hi>'s death, <hi>Acacius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Caesarea,</hi> and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the <hi>Arians,</hi> offered <hi>Cyril</hi> the See of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he should renounce the Ordination that he had received of <hi>Maximus,</hi> which he did accordingly, and serv'd in that Church in the Capacity of a Deacon, and for this was rewarded with that Bishoprick, who thereupon subtilly circumvented <hi>Heraclius,</hi> whom <hi>Maximus</hi> upon his death-bed had made his Successor, whom he divested of his Episcopal Dignity, and reduc'd to the station of a Presbyter. To this others add, that in order to this Design he was guilty of strange complyances with the <hi>Arians,</hi> that he sometimes varied<note n="i" place="margin">Rufin. l. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>23.</hi> p. <hi>235.</hi>
                     </note> in matters of Faith, and often in point of Communion; that he was infected<note n="k" place="margin">Soz. l. <hi>7.</hi> c. <hi>7.</hi> p <hi>711.</hi> vid. Socr. l. <hi>5.</hi> c. <hi>8.</hi> p. <hi>264.</hi>
                     </note> with the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Heresie, which he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards recanted; nay, that he was as zealous<note n="l" place="margin">Script. vitae Ath. gr. l. ap. Ath. T. <hi>2.</hi> p. <hi>535.</hi>
                     </note> for the <hi>Arian</hi> Impieties, as his Predecessor had been for the Catholick truth. These are the most material parts of his Charge, to which I must needs enter my dissent, and doubt not to affirm, that as they are fastned upon him, they are built upon ignorance or mistake. Were there nothing else, 'tis enough, that he is vindicated by the Deposition of those, who were as capable to know the true state of things, as S. <hi>Jerom</hi> or any of the rest. <hi>Theodorit</hi>

Than which what could have been spoken more plain and pertinent in his justification? One such authentick and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable Testimony, given by so many, and such venerable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, all Catholick Bishops, who liv'd at the same time, and could not be ignorant of his Affairs; who had then his Company with them, and his Cause before them, weighs more with me, than an hundred Reports taken up at second hand, and at a peradventure by Persons at a distance, who neither accounted it their Interest, nor made it their Business nicely to enquire into things, whether they were true or false. Not that I think the things we have mention'd to have been purely fictitious, but rather to have been blended to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by a careless confounding of Names and Persons. <hi>Baronius</hi>

Not that by this means you may be brought out of a state of ignorance, and receive the first Principles of the knowledg of God (for such your improvements in Piety, that you seem able to instruct others in matters of Religion) but that you may be the firmlier establish'd in those things, which you are wont to discourse of, and that learning hence how much God has Crown'd your Empire, deriv'd to you as a paternal Inheritance, with greater Honours, and more divine and heavenly Blessings, you may be the stronglier incited to offer up, at this time especially, the highest Praises to the supreme So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign of the World, and be inspired with a greater Vigour and Courage against your Enemies, being assured by these miraculous Attestations, that God takes a particular care of your Empire and Government. In the time of your Father <hi>Constantine,</hi> a Prince beloved of Heaven, and of bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed memory, the wholsom wood of the Cross was found at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> the divine goodness granting it as a peculiar favour to him, who set himself to embrace the true Religion, that he should make discovery of the most conceal'd holy Places. But in your time, Sir, who have so far outgone in Devotion and Piety, God is pleased to grant Prodigies, not any longer upon Earth, but from Heaven; I mean, the blessed Cross of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, the Trophy of

Wherefore we the Inhabitants of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> having beholden this miraculous Prodigy with our eyes, with all thankfulness, as becomes us, do and will adore the great God, and his only begotten Son, and both have done, and still will in this holy place offer up our continual Prayers for your Government, so dear to Heaven. I thought it not good therefore to suppress these heavenly Visions in silence, but have made it my care to convey them to you as good tidings, and instances of the Divine Benignity; that so upon the good Foundation of the Faith already embrac'd, building a further knowledge of what has thus strangely and supernaturally come to pass, you may have a firmer assurance in our Lord Jesus Christ; being confident according to your wonted trust, you may, as one that has God himself for your Assistant, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the Banner of the Cross, the greatest ground of rejoycing, and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully produce the sign that was shewed in Heaven; a Representation, at whose appearance the Heavens did greatly rejoyce and triumph. This won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Prodigy, most religious Emperor, pursuant to the Predictions of the Prophets, and to the words of Christ recorded in the Gospel, is now fulfilled, and will hereafter be yet farther fulfilled. For when our Saviour in S. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew's</hi> Gospel communicated to his blessed Apostles the notices of future things, and by them imparted them to others that convers'd with them, he most evidently foretold it, saying, <hi>And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in Heaven.</hi> This holy Book of the Gospels, when, as you are wont, you take into your hands, you will find these Predictions and Testimonies written there; to which I beseech you, Sir, attend with the greater care and diligence, by reason of those other things there described, and foretold by our Saviour, and which it concerns us with all fear, nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly to observe, lest we suffer damage from those adverse Powers that watch against us. These first Fruits of my discourses, Sir, I offer to you, being the first Messages I send from <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> to you I offer them, the sincere and most holy worshipper, together with us of Christ, the only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Son of God, who upon his Cross at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> did according to the holy Scriptures, work out the Salvation of all mankind, where he overcame death,

                  <p>From this Letter, besides the account it gives of the Prodigy, and the Reflections he makes upon it, we may observe three things with respect to <hi>Cyril</hi> himself. First, that this Epistle was written not long after his entrance upon the Bishoprick of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> being the first Fruits of his Addresses to the Emperor after his promotion to it. And indeed it must be pen'd not many months after, if <hi>Baronius</hi> has rightly fix'd the time of his Consecration to that See, which he places <hi>Ann.</hi> CCCLI. this Letter being written about the Month of <hi>May</hi> in that year. Secondly, that in the close of it he gives an evident intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his firm adherence to the <hi>Nicene</hi> Faith, while he so earnestly prayes that the Emperor may ever own and honour <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>the sacred and coessential Trinity.</hi> A plain confutation of those <hi>Arian</hi> Compliances, which about this very time are charg'd upon him. And yet far stranger is the prejudice and partiality of some late Writers<note n="w" place="margin">Riv. Crits. l. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>11.</hi> p. <hi>296, 297.</hi>
                     </note>, who from this very Epistle infer, either that <hi>Cyril</hi> was not the Author of it, or if so, that he was an <hi>Arian</hi> Heretick. Thirdly, that notwithstanding his Declaration against Flattery, yet he prudently uses very soft words, and smooth Insinuations to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, the better to sweeten his exasperated humour against the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, which by the Artifices of the <hi>Arians,</hi> seldom fail'd to have a keen edge set upon it. And this was a course which many wise and good men made use of in their Addresses to that Emperor, who passionately lov'd commendation, and was above other men, a fond admirer of himself. But to return.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. <hi>CYRIL</hi> was going securely on in the discharge of his Pastoral Cares, when great troubles and disturbances overtook him, the spring and first mover whereof was <hi>Acacius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Caesar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The truth is, <hi>Cyril</hi> looking upon his own as an Apostolick See, thought himself qualified to dispute with <hi>Acac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And herein it must be confess'd he went beyond his line; for though all Antiquity had paid a mighty Reverence to the Church of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> as a Church immediately instituted by our blessed Saviour, and that in a place which he had honoured with his Birth, Life, Sermons, and Miracles, and had made the Stage of his bloody death, a See founded by the Apostles, and from whence they

And now Recriminations are pass'd on both sides, <hi>Cyril</hi> charging <hi>Acacius</hi> with <hi>Arianism,</hi> while he himself (sayes <hi>Sozomen</hi>) was suspected of joyning with the <hi>Homoiousians,</hi> who held the Son to be of like substance with the Father; though <hi>Nicephorus,</hi> who follows <hi>Sozomen</hi> in this passage, sayes<note n="a" place="margin">

And this seems most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, for why should <hi>Acacius</hi> quarrel with <hi>Cyril,</hi> for siding with the <hi>Homoiousians,</hi> when he himself at every turn appeared in the Head of that Party, though upon every new occasion he again deserted them, and joyned with the high-slown <hi>Arians?</hi> And that he might yet further expose him, <hi>Acacius</hi> charg'd him, that in a time of raging Famine at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> when the poor People flock'd to him for relief, after all the Monies were spent, he had sold the Vessels, Utensils, Vest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and consecrated Hangings of the Church, and that one of the Vestments had been found upon a Womans back that belong'd to the Play-house by the very Person that gave it, who examining where she had it, was directed to the Merchant that had sold it, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd he bought it of the Bishop.

A thing not possible in such a confusion of accounts, and where the Records of the Church have preserv'd little more than the bare names of the Persons.

An eye he had upon the See of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and look'd upon <hi>Cyril</hi> as the only Person standing in his way, and though he did not openly discard the orthodox Doctrine, yet he was content to conceal and dissemble it for a time, as a means to procure <hi>Acacius</hi>'s favour in his advancement to that See. To him therefore he applied himself, and took part with him in his Proceedings against <hi>Cyril,</hi> whom he mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally envied and maligned, opposing not only him, but all that stood by him and assisted him. And how they succeeded in their attempts, we shall see hereafter. I shall observe no more about this matter, but that <hi>Theodorit</hi>

                     <hi>Acacius</hi> continued to cite <hi>Cyril</hi> to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; but he well knowing what Quarter he must expect from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd open Enemies, refus'd the Summons, whereupon the Sentence was finally denounc'd against him. Immediately he publish'd an Anti-remonstrance, wherein he appeal'd from their Judgment, to that of a greater and more solemn Judicature; and his appeal it seems was allow'd by the Emperor. And though <hi>Socrates</hi> sayes, he was the first and the only Person that by such an appeal transgress'd the Custom of the Ecclesiastick Law (meaning I suppose the <hi>Nicene</hi> Canons, that require all Episcopal Causes to be determin'd by the Metropolitan, and the Bishops of the Province) yet was it no more than what the necessity of those times drove him to, and what had been heretofore allow'd and practis'd in important Cases.

                     </note>, but finding that Church
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:49523:236"/> destitute of a Bishop, he went thence to <hi>Tarsus,</hi> where he fix'd his abode with <hi>Sylvanus</hi> the venerable Bishop of that place. Nor did he here indulge himself in ease and idleness, but preach'd constantly to the People. But malice like the Grave, is endless and insatiable; <hi>Acacius</hi> no sooner understood where <hi>Cyril</hi> was, and of his kind Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, but he wrote presently to <hi>Sylvanus,</hi> and gave him an account of his being depos'd, and thereby rendred incapable of Communion. But he had too great a Reverence for the man to entertain slight Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions against him, and besides was unwilling to disoblige the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who lik'd his Doctrine, and were infinitely pleas'd with his elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Sermons. So he continued in this Station till the year CCCLIX. when <hi>Constantius</hi> summon'd a Synod at <hi>Seleucia.</hi> And now he thought he had a fit opportunity to bring his Cause upon the publick Stage, wherefore he appear'd at the Synod, and resolv'd to refer his Case intirely to them. The main question at the opening of the Council was, what should first come under debate, whether Matters of Faith, or the Causes of the Bishops who had been depos'd, particularly of <hi>Cyril</hi> and some others, whose Cases had been peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recommended by the Emperor. But it was carri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d for the former, that Doctrinal Controversies should be handled in the first place, and what the Proceedings of the Council were in that Matter, we have elsewhere related. The issue was, that no composure being to be hoped for between the dissenting Parties, <hi>Leonas</hi> the Imperial Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner, who favoured the <hi>Acacian</hi> Faction, after four several Sessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, broke up and dissolv'd the Synod. However the Catholick Bishops (who were but few) together with <hi>Basil</hi> of <hi>Ancyra, Sylvanus</hi> of <hi>Tarsus,</hi> and the rest that opposed <hi>Acacius</hi> and his Party, continued sitting, and cited <hi>Acacius</hi> and his Followers to the Synod, to make good their charge against <hi>Cyril</hi> and others, but they refus'd to come. Indeed <hi>Acacius</hi> at the very beginning of the Council had refus'd to take his place, unless <hi>Cyril,</hi> as a Person depos'd, were excluded the Synod. And when some, out of an eager desire of Peace, perswaded him to withdraw, assuring him, that as soon as they had discussed Matters of Faith, they would proceed to the Examination of his Case, he refused, not knowing but his retiring might be interpreted an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of his guilt, at least give his Enemies too great an advantage against him. After several Summons to no purpose, the Synod pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded against the absent Bishops; some they suspended from Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, till they had given satisfaction in the Crimes charged upon them, among whom were <hi>Asterius, Eusebius, Eutyohius,</hi> &amp;c. others they depos'd, especially <hi>Acacius,</hi> the head of the Party, <hi>George</hi> of <hi>Alexandria, Ʋranius</hi> of <hi>Tyre,</hi> and many more; nor is any doubt to be made (though the Acts of that Synod mention it not) but they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor'd <hi>Cyril</hi> and the rest that had been depos'd by the <hi>Acacian</hi> Party.</p>

                        <p>THE heavy Taxes that have been unwarrantly laid upon you, and those vast sums of Gold you have been forced to bring into the Exchequer, have far exceeded those other Oppressions and Slaveries which in the times foregoing you have undergone. A great part of which I have seen with mine own Eyes, and have discovered more from the Writs that have been directed and issued out against you. And at this time another Assesment is prepared for you, which I have stop'd and prohibited, and out of a detestation of so unrighteous an act, have burn'd the Warrants that lay ready among my Records to be sent out against you; so that none may henceforth be able so much as to affright you with the Report of such a piece of injustice. The Cause of all which injuries is not so much to be attributed to my Brother <hi>Constantius</hi> of worthy memory, as to some men of barbarous Principles, and Atheistical Tempers, that stood about him, and were fed at his Table; whom I took with mine own hands, and threw them headlong into a deep pit, where they irrecoverably perish'd, that so the least monument might not remain of them. For my part being resolved to shew you all the favour and kindness I can, I have advised your Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Julus</hi> the venerable <hi>Patriarch,</hi> to stop the Tribute that's said to be impos'd upon you, and that no man henceforth shall abuse your Nation with such intolerable exactions, but that you may to all intents live pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceably and securely under my Reign, and being free from farther trouble, may recommend the prosperity of my Empire in your more vigorous and hearty Prayers to God, the great Creator, and best of Beings, who has been pleas'd with his most holy right hand to place the Crown upon my head. A Service which I cannot otherwise expect from you. For they who are oppress'd with Sollicitudes and Cares, are wont to be Persons of narrow and contracted minds, and cannot with that freedom lift up their hands to God in Prayer, while those who are wholly freed from anxious Cares, and enjoy a calm and compos'd state of Soul, are sittest to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede for the happiness of the Empire, and to offer up their Devotions to the great God, who alone is able to order and dispose my Reign to the best advantage, and to the most excellent purposes, which I hope and pray he will do. This is that which you ought principally to attend, that so having succesfully manag'd my <hi>Persian</hi> expedition, and the holy City of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> (which you have so long and so earnestly desir'd to see reinha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited) being rebuilt by my endeavours, I may dwell in it, and together with you there offer up our joynt Prayers to the supreme Being of the World.</p>

                     </note> for the Heads of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Nation, of whom he enquired, why, since the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> oblig'd them to offer Sacrifices, they had laid aside that Custom. They told him, the Sacrifices of their Law were determin'd to a particular place, and might not be offered up any where but at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> where their Temple was ruin'd, and whence they themselves had been long since banish'd. Hereupon he commanded them forthwith to go and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the Temple, to retrive the Customs of their Ancestors, and to Worship God according to the Laws and Rites of their Religion.
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:49523:238"/> Herein he drove on a double design, first to draw over the <hi>Jews</hi> to the <hi>Pagan</hi> Superstition, which he the rather hoped for, because both agreed in Oblations and Sacrifices, and that he observ'd the main bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the <hi>Jews</hi> took up in the Letter and outside of their Law, and understood little of the spiritual and mystical Sence; and next he hop'd to give a fatal wound to Christianity, and by restoring the Temple and the <hi>Jewish</hi> Worship, against which Christ had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd so flat a doom, to prove our Saviour a false Prophet and Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor. The <hi>Jews,</hi> though they had had near CC. years sad experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the truth of our Lord's prediction, yet receiv'd the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant with a joy inexpressible, it being an opportunity which they had often wish'd, but could never hope for, and were so elated with it, that they began insolently to Scorn and Triumph over Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, threatning to make them feel as direful effects of their severity, as ever themselves had heretofore done from the <hi>Roman</hi> Powers. No sooner was the news spread abroad, but Contributions came in from all hands, yea the very Women sold their Jewels and Ornaments to advance the Work, and what was wanting, the Emperor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded should be allow'd out of his own Exchequer, appointing <hi>Alypius</hi> of <hi>Antioch</hi> (who had sometimes been <hi>Propraefect</hi> of <hi>Brittain</hi>) overseer of the work, with Power to call in the Governour of the Province to his assistance. And now all things were in readiness, the most exquisite Artists drawn together from all Parts, Stone, Bricks, and Timber prepar'd, and all other necessary Materials and Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, nay they are said to have made Spades, Mattocks, and Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets of Silver for the greater Honour to the Work. In short, no help was wanting, even the softer and the weaker sex laid their hands to the Work, and carried out the Rubbish in their Laps, yea the very <hi>Gentiles</hi> refus'd not their assistance, meerly out of oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Christians. <hi>Cyril</hi> the Bishop beheld all this, and calling to mind <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Prophecy concerning it, and how plainly it had been ratified by our Saviour, openly told them that even now the time was come, that <hi>not one Stone should be left upon another</hi> in that Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but that the doom which our Lord had so peremptorily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd against it should be accomplish'd. And the Event justified his Prediction. For having digg'd and clear'd the Foundation, on the next day towards night a sudden Storm arose, that carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way those vast heaps of Rubbish which they had thrown into a neighbouring Valley, and dispers'd many thousand Bushels of Lime and Sands which they had prepar'd for the Building. This was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd with a dreadful Earth-quake, which cast up Stones from the Foundation, and slew many, and overturn'd some adjoyning Houses that slew more, and those that escap'd were drawn out with broken Leggs and Arms, bruis'd and almost wounded to death. And when notwithstanding all this they still attempted to proceed, Balls of Fire broke as 'twere from under the Foundation, and not only burnt their Tools and Instruments, but seiz'd upon and consum'd the Workmen and Spectators. The fright was great, and every man fled to save himself, and the main Crowd drove towards a little Church hard by, wherein they were wont to bestow their Tools, but when they came to it, they found it suddenly shut and barr'd against them (though there was no Person within) and when they attempted to
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:49523:238"/> break open the Doors, a Fire rush'd out upon them, that destroyed many, and miserably scorch'd the rest, running up and down the streets a great part of that day. At night the Cloaths of all the <hi>Jews</hi> had black Crosses with Stars between them impress d upon them, which when the Infidels perceiv'd in the morning, they endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but in vain, to wash them out, and thereupon partly afraid, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly asham'd, desisted and ran away. And though these strange and miraculous interposals of the Divine Power and Providence brought over some, who being baptizd, sought by Prayers and Praises to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tone him, whom heretofore they had blasphemed and affronted, yet the greatest part continued still in their ancient obstinacy and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. Of so little force are miracles themselves to convert a People, without the concurrent efficacy of the Divine Grace to recommend them.</p>

                     </note> At the clearing the Foundation, a Stone was taken up that covered the mouth of a deep foursquare Cave, cut out in the Rock, into which one of the Labourers being let down by a Rope, found it full of Water to the middle of the Leg, and in the midst a Pillar reaching a little above the Water, whereon lay a Book wrapt up in a fine and clean Linnen Cloath. Being drawn up, the Linnen was observ'd to be fresh and unperished, and the Book being unfolded, was found to the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all, but especially the amazement of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Gospel of S. <hi>John,</hi> with the first words in the Front writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in great Capital Letters, IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, AND THE WORD WAS WITH GOD, AND THE WORD WAS GOD.

However the blind and obstinate Wretches persisted in their Supplications to the Emperor, to joyn with them in the Restauration of the Temple; who accordingly furnish'd them with Money, sent them men of Authority for Overseers, and skilful Artists from all parts, and left no Stone unturn'd, that he might at once lay a Foundation to seduce them over to Idolatrous Worship, and defeat the Prediction of our Saviour.

And hereof we are all Witnesses; for these things hapned not long since in our own time; and consider what a firm and unshaken Triumph they give to our Cause. For they hapned not in the Reign of Pious and Christian Emperors, lest any should pretend that Christians came with armed Violence, and hindered the re-edification of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; no 'twas then when our Religion was under Hatches, when we stood in danger of our Lives, when all Liberty so much as of

The youngest he was of three Children, <hi>Marcellina</hi> and <hi>Satyrus</hi> being born before him. He was nurs'd in the <hi>Praetorium,</hi> or Governours Palace, and sleeping one day in his Cradle in the open Court, a swarm of Bees settled about his face, and gently crept in and out of his open mouth without doing him the least harm. Which his Father, who was then walking hard by, perceiving, charg'd the Maid that attended him, not to disturb or drive them away, who soon after mounted up aloft into the Air, till they quite vanish'd out of sight. Surpriz'd with the accident, he told those that were about him (and 'twas a true Presage) this Boy, if he lives, will prove a great man. How long his Father liv'd after this, is not known, 'tis probable he died during his Government in those

After whose decease his Mother with the whole Family re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to <hi>Rome,</hi> and the place is still shew'd where their House stood, turn'd at this day into a Convent of <hi>Benedictine</hi> Monks. Amongst the sportive Passages of his Childhood, this is not the least memorable, that when he espied his Mother and Sister kissing the Bishop's hand, (according to the pious Reverence which in those dayes they paid to the Governours of the Church) he merrily offered them his hand to kiss, which he told them they ought to do, for that he was sure he should be a Bishop. His Education was suitable to his Birth, liberal and ingenuous, and as he grew up, he made himself Master of all the Learning that <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Greece</hi> could afford: and for Religion, he was form'd to that, especially by the Care and Councils of his Sister <hi>Marcellina,</hi> who having devoted her self to a state of Celibacy, spent her time in the Exercises of Piety and Devotion, and by her converse and example, train'd him up to a life of Vertue, and secur'd him from those snares and vices, which a place of so many Charms and Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations as <hi>Rome</hi> was, must have betray'd him to.</p>

Choose such a one (said he) and place him upon the Episcopal Throne, and we our selves will readily submit our Crowns and Scepters to his councils and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and as men obnoxious to humane frailties, will receive his reproofs and admonitions as the most wholsom Physick. The Bishops humbly besought his Majesty, that as one capable enough to judge, he would please to nominate the Person. But he modestly declin'd it, telling them 'twas too great an affair for him to meddle in, and that they themselves were upon all accounts fitter to make a wiser and better choice. With that they took their leave, and went to the Cathedral to consult about it. And now different Interests began to shew themselves: though <hi>Auxentius</hi> was dead, his Party was yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, and vigorously contended for a man of their Communion, and big words were spoken of what they would do, if they were rejected; the Catholicks on the other hand labouring as hard for an Orthodox Bishop. Factions grew strong, and the whole City was divided, and things openly tended to a Tumult and Insurrection: which <hi>Ambrose</hi> hearing, and being ready according to the duty of his place to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all publick disorder, hasten'd immediately to the Church, where in a grave and pathetical Oration he exhorted the people to peace and concord, and to a quiet submission to the Laws. His Speech ended, the voice of a Child was heard from amidst the Crowd, <hi>Ambrose is Bishop.</hi> The hint was soon taken, and as if it had been a voice from heaven the whole Company unanimously cried out, that <hi>Ambrose</hi> should be the man: And herein both Catholicks and <hi>Arians</hi> did the more readily consent, in that neither Party seem'd to have got the better of the other.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. <hi>AMBROSE</hi> was infinitely surpriz'd at the passage, and the joyful Acclamations of the people, and peremptorily refused to comply with them. And to let them see how unfit he was to make a Bishop, he put on a rough merciless humour: for going out of the Church, he sat down on the Bench of Justice, and sending for some Malefactors to be brought before him, commanded them to be rackt with great rigor and severity, hoping by this means to take off the edg of the peoples inclination towards him, who yet nothing discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd, cried out, <hi>your sin be upon us.</hi> This artifice failing, he tried an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:49523:243"/> contriving it, that Women of lewd and common fame should be seen publickly going into, and about his house, which he doubted not would be looked upon as highly unbecoming a person design'd for the Episcopal Office. But the people quickly smelt it out to be a piece of pageantry, and with redoubled importunity cried out, <hi>your sin be upon us.</hi> No remedy was now left, but directly to run away. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly at mid-night he stole out of the City, and design'd for <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinum</hi> a neighbouring City, but missed his way; and having wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred up and down all night, found himself in the morning again at <hi>Milan</hi> at the <hi>Roman</hi> Gate. He is presently laid hold on, and a Guard set about him, till the Emperors pleasure might be known in the case, without whose leave no publick Officer might be admitted to holy Orders; but in that they met with no opposition, for the Emperor knowing him to be a man of singular integrity easily gave his consent. <hi>Ambrose</hi> in the mean while had again made his escape, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn himself to the Country-house of one <hi>Laurentius,</hi> a great man, and his intimate friend, with whom he had hid himself. And now they were wholly at a loss how to retrive him. But the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror had given order to the <hi>Vicarius</hi> or Lievtenant of the Civil Diocess to see the thing effectually done; and he had publisht an Edict that none under peril of his head, and confiscation of his Estate should dare to conceal him. <hi>Laurentius</hi> hereupon was forc'd to break up his San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, and brought him back to <hi>Milan;</hi> and now seeing 'twas to no purpose any longer to resist the pleasure of the Divine Providence, he yielded to lay down the publick Rods and Axes, and to take up the <hi>Crosier,</hi> only demanding that he might be baptiz'd by a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Bishop, for as yet was only a <hi>Catechumen.</hi> So he was baptiz'd, and eight days after with the universal acclamation of the people so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly consecrated to that See, the Emperor himself (who was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at the Ordination) concluding the Solemnity with his short gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulatory Address to heaven, <hi>I thank thee, O Lord Almighty, and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, that thou hast made choice of this person to whom I had committed the power over m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And therefore when not long after he complain'd to him of the Misdemeanours of some in Authority, aggravating their faults with great freedom and impartiality, the good Emperor answered, <hi>I was heretofore no stranger to this liberty you take, and yet was so far from opposing, that I freely consented to your Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: go on therefore as the Divine Law commands, and cure the distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers and maladi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And the Emperor it seems had granted their Request. Which when S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> understood, he represented to him the inconvenience of the thing, that a General Council was wholly needless in this Case, the adverse Party being inconsiderable, and that himself, and some of the Neighbour Bishops were abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly enough for their Confutation, that it was unreasonable for the sake of two rotten Hereticks (as the Council Styles them) to trouble the Governors of the Church through the whole Empire, many of whom were upon the Account of distance, age, infirmity, or poverty, altogether unable to take so long a Journey, or to be absent from their Cures. Hereupon a Synod out of <hi>Italy</hi> and the
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:49523:246"/> Neighbouring Provinces was indicted at <hi>Aquileia,</hi> where met of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian, Dalmatian</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Bishops with the Legates from <hi>Africk</hi> and <hi>France</hi> to the number of XXXII.

Several private and preliminary Conferences the Fathers had with the two <hi>Arian</hi> Bishops, but no good being done, they met in a Synodal Assembly <hi>Septemb.</hi> V. <hi>Ann.</hi> CCCLXXXI. and the President having propos'd that for the clearer justification of their actions, the Proceedings of the Synod might be entred upon Record, the Emperor's Letter was first read, whereby they were summon'd, and constituted Judges of the Cause before them. Then was read an Epistle of <hi>Arius,</hi> containing the chief points of his <hi>dogmata,</hi> and <hi>Palladius</hi> required to declare what he thought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it. <hi>Palladius</hi> answered, that by the Emperor's Letters which they had read, it was evident, that they had been the Cause, why there had not been a full and general Council, that the Bishops of their Party (meaning the <hi>Orientalists</hi>) were absent, and therefore they could not answer. <hi>Ambrose</hi> replyed, that this was done in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance with the Custom of former times, whereby the <hi>Oriental</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops were wont to assemble in the <hi>East,</hi> and at the same time the <hi>Western</hi> in the <hi>West.</hi> However to take away all pretence of cavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, the Prefect of <hi>Italy</hi> had sent a Summons to them of the <hi>East,</hi> that if they pleas'd, they might convene with them; but they keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their old course, had staid at home. The other pleaded, that it was a fraud, and that they had herein circumvented and imposed upon the Emperor, and therefore he was not obliged to answer. But <hi>Ambrose</hi> setting aside the Case of the <hi>Eastern</hi> Prelates, press'd hard for a positive answer: You have heard <hi>(said he) Arius</hi>'s Epistle read, you are wont when challenged, to deny your self to be an <hi>Arian,</hi> either now condemn him, or defend his Cause. But the crafty He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick would not be drawn out of his old reserve; he told them, they were an incompetent Judicatory, that he had promis'd indeed to make good his Cause, but in a lawful trial, that he was come thither in expectation to have found a General Council, whose decision he would not anticipate by answering there, where those of his own Party were wanting. After a great deal of wrangling about this matter, they debated the Letter of <hi>Arius</hi> from point to point, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the main disputing Part lay upon <hi>Ambrose,</hi> who took up, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted the broken answers which <hi>Palladius</hi> gave to the several In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogatories, the Fathers at the end of each denouncing an <hi>Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> against the maintainers of every Point, as may be seen in the Acts of the Council, extant<note n="x" place="margin">Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

In which 'tis not unpleasant to observe what Artifices the man makes use of to save himself; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he endeavours to escape by subtle and sly Evasions, as when he owns our Lord to be the true Son of God, but when press'd to it, would not acknowledg him to be true God; and to be good, but would not say; he was a good God, refusing to express himself in any other terms than these, <hi>a good Father begat a good Son.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he pleaded he could not answer, in that he had not Notaries of his own to take what pass'd, pretending partiality on their side,
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:49523:247"/> and therefore required that his own Notaries might be admitted. Which being granted, he flew off from that. Otherwhiles he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, that the People might be indifferently let in as Spectators and Judges of what pass'd on either side; which though 'twas not absolutely denyed, yet S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> told him, that in those matters 'twas the place of Bishops to Judge the Laity, and not the Laity to Judge the Bishops. In short, throughout the whole Procedure, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he was pinch'd with a Question or an Argument which he could not evade, he presently retired to his common Refuge, that they were not a General Council, and to such a one only he was oblig'd and resolved to answer: Particularly he excepted against the Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent as an incompetent Judge, charging him with impiety and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice; and when <hi>Sabinus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Placentia</hi> asked him what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties he had to object against <hi>Ambrose,</hi> he gave them no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply than before, that he would answer in a full Council, when all Persons concern'd were present, S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> answered, <hi>I desire to be charg'd and convicted in the presence of my Brethren, if I, who strenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously assert the Faith, seem impious to you, speak out and say, what are those impious assertions I am guilty of.</hi> But the bold man thought fit to let that Accusation fall, which he was not able to make good. After near seven Hours dispute (for so long the Session lasted) S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> passed Sentence upon him, pronouncing him unworthy of the Episcopal Office, and that a Catholick should be ordained to his See; which was ratified by an universal <hi>Anathema</hi> of the Synod de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced against him. After which at the Presidents motion all the Bishops did in order one by one give their particular Votes for his Condemnation. Next they proceeded to <hi>Secundianus,</hi> and having for some time disputed the case with him, could drive him to no other resolution, than that he confess'd our Lord to be the true only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Son of God, but would not explicitly assert, that he was the true God, whereupon the like Sentence was pass'd upon him. With them also the Synod censur'd and condemned <hi>Attalus</hi> a revolted Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter, a man it seems of great age, having been present with <hi>Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinus</hi> his Bishop in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, the determinations whereof he had together with his Bishop subscribed, but afterwards recanted, and sheltred himself under <hi>Valens</hi> the intruding Bishop of <hi>Petavio,</hi> a City in <hi>Pannonia,</hi> who being for his misdemeanours publickly thrust out by the People, had betrayed the Countrey to the <hi>Goths,</hi> in whose barbarous Habit he dress'd himself, and appeared in the Head of them against the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, and now went up and down the Country, which he filled with unwarrantable Ordinations, and though summon'd to the Council, and himself not far off (having taken up his Station at this time at <hi>Milan</hi>) yet refused to appear. <hi>Attalus</hi> being urg'd with his Subscription, refused to give any answer, and so suffered Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to pass against him. All which being dispatched, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil arose, having deputed Legates to the Emperors, and by them a Letter<note n="y" place="margin">Ext. ib. col. <hi>993.</hi>

His Arguments, though many, are very weak and trifling, and do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve an operose Confutation, being such as may be levelled against almost against any ancient writing; nor is there any more just reason to question these, than the Acts of most ancient Councils. The whole stress of his bold conjecture rests upon no firmer a bottom than this, that <hi>Vigilius</hi> affirms that he had written against <hi>Palladius</hi> (who had answered S. <hi>Ambrose</hi>) and immediately without any other Warrant he concludes, that the proceedings of this Synod were part of that Book, and as such he has publish'd them in his Collection of <hi>Vigilius</hi>'s works. Nor does he produce ono Syllable of any Writer, either of those or the following ages to justifie what he says, or any ancient Copy, that ascribes these acts to <hi>Vigilius.</hi> And if such a Liberty may be taken, what can be safe? Farewel all ancient Monuments, when a confident conjecture may dispose of them, how, and to what use it please. And whereas he urges, that <hi>Vigilius</hi> wrote the Acts and Disputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Arius</hi> and <hi>Athanasius</hi> before <hi>Probus,</hi> appointed by the Emperor to be Judge and Moderator, and that in the way of a formal histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Account, when as all was but a feigned Scheme; 'tis granted he did so. But then withal, 'tis evident both that ancient Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripts entitle that piece to <hi>Vigilius,</hi> and which is more, <hi>Vigilius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self elsewhere<note n="a" place="margin">Contr.

A Cause which he insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated with great smoothness and subtilty, and manag'd with all the Advantages that could be given it by the Zeal of a Pagan, and the Eloquence of an Orator. No sooner did S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> hear of this, but he wrote<note n="k" place="margin">Epist. XXX. ibid.</note> to the Emperor <hi>Valentinian</hi> to put a stop to it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting to him, that as the Empire was under them, so they <q>themselves were accountable unto God, from whom they could not expect Protection and Security, unless they sincerely Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship'd him the only true God, the supreme Soveraign of the World, and gave no way to Superstition and Idolatry; that his Majesty having so openly declared his devotion for the Christian Religion, 'twas a wonder how any could hope to make use of his Authority to establish the <hi>Gentile</hi> Rites, or his Exchequer to defray the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of their Sacrifices, especially they who had never been sparing of the blood of Christians, who had pull'd down their Churches, and had denyed them the common Liberty of teaching Children; that the things they petition'd for had been long since taken away by the Edicts of former Emperors, and lately by his own Brother <hi>Gratian</hi> of famous memory, whose pious Constitutions he ought not to violate, and though they had been wanting herein, yet he himself ought to have done it, that he should take care that no man should impose upon his tender unexperienc'd years, much less an Idolatrous <hi>Gentile;</hi> great men were to be regarded, but God to be preferr'd before all, whose Cause here was neerly concern'd, and to whom to give precedence, could be no injury to any. Was it fit that Christians should be forc'd to come to the Senate, and take their Oaths before a prophane impious Altar? should this be allow'd in his Reign? What was this but to acknowledg an Idol to be an Almighty Being? could men have the face to beg of him to command the Altar to be erected, and to bear the Charge of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Sacrifices? A thing not to be done without plain sacriledge and impiety. That therefore he besought him not to sign any such Warrant, and as a Bishop conjur'd him by the Faith that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd, wherein all the Bishops had joyn'd with him, but that it
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:49523:250"/> was look'd upon as a thing incredible, that such a thing should ever have been mov'd in his Consistory, or petition'd for by the Senate; as indeed it was not, but only by a small inconsiderable Party, that assum'd to themselves that august venerable name, the far greater number being Christians. That he should do well herein to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise with his Colleague and Parent the Emperor <hi>Theodosius,</hi> whom in all other cases he was wont to consult, and much more ought in this, no Cause being greater and more important than that of Religion; that were it a matter of civil cognizance, he should leave it to others to undertake, but being that of Religion, 'twas proper for him as a Bishop to meddle in it; to which end he desired his Majesty to send him a Copy of the Petition, and he would return a full answer to it, that so his Colleague being perfectly inform'd of all things, might take order in the Case: That if he acted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to this Advice, they that were Bishops must declare that they knew not how to bear with it; his Majesty might come to Church, if he pleas'd, but he would either find there no Bishop to minister to him, or one that would oppose him, and let him know, that the Church of God takes no gifts from him, that restores and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies Pagan Temples, that Christs Altar rejects his Offerings, who erects Altars to Idols. What would he answer to his deceased Brother, who must needs repent that ever he made him a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partner in the Empire, which by his care of Religion he had left secure and firm, and by this means would receive a more fatal Blow, than that deaths-wound that had been given him by his Enemies. Nay what would he answer his Father, whose Piety this course must needs reproach, who could never have believ'd so great a wickedness should be attempted, that <hi>Gentiles</hi> should sacrifice in that publick Court, that is, that Pagans should insult and triumph, while Christians were by, and against their wills forc'd to be present at those Heathen Solemnities. That therefore he humbly besought his Majesty, that reflecting how great an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury the passing such an Edict would be first to God, and then both to his Father and his Brother, he would take that course that should appear to be most acceptable to God, and most advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to himself.</q>

                                 <p>AS soon as the most illustrious, and your ever loyal Senate, had taken cognizance, that the Vices of the times were subdued by the Laws, and the infamy of the past ages expiated by the piety of our present Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they, following so good an Example, have thought fit to improve the present occasion to express their grief, and again to constitute me the mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger and manager of their Complaints, who find themselves denyed the priviledge of access to their venerable Prince by the arts of bad men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they foresee, that, when he knows their grievances, he will do them justice. I therefore in a double Capacity, both as your Deputy do promote the publick good, and as the Envoy of the Citizens of <hi>Rome</hi> recommend their desires; in this we are all agreed, because at length men are grown so wise as not to espouse the factions of Courtiers, when they manage their private Fewds. For to be respected, to be honour'd, to be lov'd is a more welcome piece of <hi>Grandeur,</hi> than to be an Emperor; for who can endure, that private quarrels should obstruct the happiness of the Commonwealth? The Senate justly prosecutes those men, who prefer the satisfactions of their own Ambition before the reputation of their Prince; while it is the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of our time, and industry to be a guard, and security to your Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency. For when we keep, and defend the Constitutions of our Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, the Laws, and Sanctions, and as it were the fate of our Country, what do we, but advance the glory of the Times? Which is never greater, than when you, that are concern'd, think nothing lawful, that thwarts the practises of your forefathers.</p>
                                 <p>And to that end we humbly request that state of Religion may be restor'd to us, which for so many ages hath been beneficial to the Republick; and certainly if we reckon up the Princes of either perswasion, we shall find that your immediate predecessor was no Enemy to those usages, but he, who went before him, a great admirer, and observer of the Rites, we plead for; if therefore the piety of the ancient Emperors be insufficient to make an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, let the smooth, and artificial carriage of those, who immediately pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded you, incline you. Who is there so much a Friend to the Barbarians, as not to complain of the loss of the <hi>Altar</hi> of <hi>Victory?</hi> We are cautious with respect to Posterity, and are willing to avoid whatever wears the portraiture of ill-luck; l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Let those slight this Deity, who have never experimented its favours, but I could wish, that you would not desert a Patronage, that hath been so instrumental to the magnifying of your Triumphs. Every man is a votary to that Goddess; for no man can deny, but that which he professes to pray for, ought to be honour'd. But if the fatal Omen will not affright you, yet at least the Altar ought to be left untouch'd, as an Ornament of the Senate-house, and let me beg you, that what Religion we were brought up in when we were boy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                                 <pb n="378" facs="tcp:49523:251"/>
                                 <p>You see, that the design of the August Emperor <hi>Constantius,</hi> and that deservedly, prov'd abortive, and all such Patterns are to be avoided by you, which you find by experience to be of no long continuance. By this means we contrive a way how to eternize your Fame, and Majesty, that Posterity may find nothing in your management of Affairs fit to be reform'd. [This Altar being taken away] where shall we swear to observe your Laws and Statutes? What Notion of Religion shall affright the profligate from Perjury? It is true, God is every where, and the perfidious Wretch can be in no place safe, but yet the awe of a Deity present with us in such a place, is a mighty instrument to deter men from vice. That one Altar preserves the whole People in Ʋnity; that one Altar keeps every private Person from breach of trust, nor does any thing give greater authority and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to our Decrees, than that they are made by Senators sworn at these Altars. Shall therefore the Habitation of the Gods be profan'd by Perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries? And will our most venerable Princes think this a likely and probable Course, who are themselves secur'd in their Persons and Government by the Oaths of their Subjects?</p>
                                 <p>But you will object, the most August Emperor <hi>Constantius</hi> did the same. Let us rather imitate the rest of the actions of that Prince, who would never have adventured on such an attempt, had any of his Predecessors so mistook the measures of Government; for the miscarriages of former Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are lessons of Correction to their Successors, and that man easily amends, who is warn'd by the ill Example of those that went before him. It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that that Prince, your Majesties Predecessor, in attempting so great an innovation, was not aware of the envy and discontent that attended the Action. But will that defence serve your turn, if we wilfully imitate, what we remember hath been formerly disallow'd? Let your Majesties take Patterns from the other actions of that Prince, which are fitter to be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd; he took away nothing from the priviledges of the <hi>Vestal</hi> Virgins, he confer'd the Revenues of the Priesthood on the Nobility, and out of the Exchequer allowed the Expences of the Sacrifices, and other Religious Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servances, and being attended in Pomp by the Senate through all the Streets of that immortal City, cast his eyes pleasantly on the Temples, read the names of the gods, to whom they were dedicated, written over their gates, made inquiry into the Original of the Buildings, and admired the piety of the Founders. And whereas himself was of another perswasion, yet he was never willing to abolish, and extirpate this that was the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the Empire; for every man hath his peculiar Rites, and Modes of Worship. The supreme Divinity that governs the World, has assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed several tutelar Guardians to every City: For as every man at his first conception has a distinct Soul, so has every Nation a particular <hi>genius</hi> allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to it. To these considerations we may add also the advantage of these Rites, which does especially recommend these Deities to men; for whereas all the Reason that asserts a Divinity, is in a great measure in the dark, whence can we better derive our knowledg of the Gods, than from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance and instances of our former Prosperity? Now if Antiquity be sufficient to render Religion venerable to us, we ought to preserve that Faith, which hath continued for so many ages, and to follow our Parents, who herein happily trod in the steps of their Progenitors. Let us imagine <hi>Rome</hi> it self now present, and thus pleading her Cause before them.</p>

                                 <p>
                                    <q>O you best of Princes, you Fathers of your Country, reverence my gray hairs, which the Rites of Religion have brought me to, and grant, that I may serve Heaven with the formerly-establish'd Ceremonies, for I do not repent me of them. Let me live according to my ancient Customs, being a free City. 'Twas this way of Worship brought all the World un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my Laws, these Rites kept <hi>Hannibal</hi> from my Walls, and repell'd the <hi>Gauls</hi> from the <hi>Capitol;</hi> and have I been heretofore so often rescued that I may, now I am grown old, be handled with Severity? Shall I see what new institution this is? Sure I am to reclaim old age, is an unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, fruitless, and dishonourable undertaking. We therefore beg your leave, and in that, security for our Countrey Gods, and for our private Deities. It is but just, that that Divinity which all men adore, should be esteemed but one. We cast our eyes on the same Stars, the Heaven is in common, and the same World incloses us. What matters it, by what methods men make enquiry after truth? One Path does not lead to the knowledge of so great a secret.</q>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>But (it may be objected) these are the Discourses of men, who are at too much leisure. We now tender you our Petitions, we do not dispute, or contend. Consider what great Benefit has accrued to your Exchequer, by taking away the Priviledges and Revenues of the <hi>Vestal</hi> Virgins? Our most liberal, and munificent Emperors deny that, which the most frugal, and parcimonious freely gave; and which the <hi>Vestals</hi> regard only as 'tis an honourable stipend and recompence of their Chastity. For as their Vail is an Ornament to their heads, so it is one of the <hi>Insignia</hi> of their Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, that they are exempted from all sort of Offices, it is but the bare name of freedom from Impositions, which they desire, for their Poverty secures them from all great Payments. But perhaps it may be said, those men advance their Reputation, that lessen their Revenue, because those Virgins, who have dedicated themselves for the publick safety gain in Merits, what they lose in their Revenues. But let such Methods of filling your Coffers never be practised, the Treasury of good Princes is not to be augmented by the Ruins of the Priests, but by the Spoils of their Enemies; and will the greatest gain make Compensation for the envy which will attend you?</p>
                                 <p>But because Covetousness is a Vice, with which you are unacquainted, this makes their Case the more deplorable, who have lost their former subsistence. For whatever is alienated under those Princes, who have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd the love of Riches, and hate Rapine and Extortion, only turns to the detriment of him who is the looser, but gratifies no appetite of him, that seizes it: The Lands, which were given by the Will of your dying Progenitors to the <hi>Vestals</hi> and their Officers, are now detain'd by your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer; but let me beseech you, O you Ministers of Justice, that your City may enjoy the private Legacies bequeathed to holy uses. Let men se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely make their last Wills, and be assur'd they have not to deal with Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous Princes, but such who will ratifie what they have bequeath'd. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, I beseech you, to make the World thus happy. This one Example creates great disquiets to all dying Persons; doth the Religion of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> not come under the Protection of the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws? By what name shall we call the alienation of the sacred Patrimony, which no Law, no Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident ever made liable to Confiscation. Freed-men receive Legacies, nay Servants are not denyed the Priviledge of having what is bequeath'd to them by Will, only the noble Virgins, and the Attendants on these Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, upon which the fate of the Empire does so much depend, are ejected
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:49523:252"/> out of their Estates, which have devolv'd on them by Inheritance. To what purpose is it to vow Virginity for the safety of the Republick, and to call in the assistances of Heaven to eternize your Empire, to assist your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and to second your Troops with unseen, but friendly Powers, and to make ardent and effectual Prayers for the safety of all your Subjects, and at the same time to be denyed those common Priviledges which belong to them, equally with the rest of your People. It is better at this rate to serve men than the Gods. We injure the Commonwealth, which never yet got any thing by being ingrateful. Let no man think, I am now only an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate for the Cause of Religion; such attempts as these have been the Source and Original of all the Calamities, that have befallen the World.</p>
                                 <p>Our Parents testified the honour they had for the <hi>Vestal</hi> Virgins, and the Priests of the gods by making Laws for their competent maintenance, and honest Priviledges; and this donation continued in its integrity, till the dayes of our degenerate Bankers, who have converted the Revenues of sacred Chastity into a stipend for the vilest Porters. A fact presently at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with a publick Famine, and all the Provinces were deceiv'd in their expectations of a plentiful Harvest; the fault was not in the Earth, nor do we charge it upon the Stars; no rust did eat it, nor was it choak'd with Darnel. It was the Sacriledge that was then committed, that made the year barren; for who could expect to have Bread, when the Religious were robb'd of their dues? Verily if there be any other Example of a like Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity, let us impute their great Famine only to chance, or to the various seasons of the year; a dry wind was the cause of this barrenness; and now men live upon the buds of Trees, and the poorer sort of Boors are again forc'd to eat Acorns; did our forefathers ever lye under such astonishing Judgments, when the Ministers of Religion were maintained by an honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able allowance out of the publick Treasury? When were men forc'd to shake the Oak for meat, or to sustain themselves with the roots of Herbs? When ever happened it, that the wants of one place were unsupplyed by the plenty of another as long as the Corn was in common distributed to the People, and to the sacred Virgins; for the provisions made for the Priests were a primary Cause of the fertility of the Countrey, and it was rather a kindness done to your Land, than a piece of Charity to the holy men. Do you make any doubt, whether that was anciently given to procure a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral plenty, the taking away of which the present scarcity has sufficiently reveng'd?</p>
                                 <p>But some men may say, there is no reason, that the Expences of another Religion should be born by the publick; let such a determination never find a place in the minds of our excellent Princes, that what was given to a few Persons to hold in common, should be accounted as if it belong'd to the publick Revenue; for whereas the whole Commonwealth does consist of single Persons, whatever proceeds from the Republick, becomes presently the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of Individuals. You, we acknowledg, superintend, and govern all things, but withal, you are the keepers of every man's Liberties, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice sways more with you, than insolent Licentiousness. Do but consult your own munificent thoughts, whether they can esteem those things to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Publick, which you have already appropriated to other uses. Whatever Profits have been once devoted to the honour of the City, cease from thenceforwards to belong to the donors, and what was in its Original a largess, by custom and time becomes a debt.</p>

                                 <p>That man therefore attempts to fill your sacred mind with a vain fear, who affirms, that you are conscious of being accessory, and consenting to the Donation, unless you incur the Envy of cancelling such grants. May all the unknown Tutelary Deities of all Sects and Opinions be favourable to your Clemency; but above all, may those Powers which were so propitious to your Ancestors, become your Guardians, may they defend you, and you adore them. We intercede for no other Religion, but that which secur'd the Empire to your Majesty's sacred Father, which gave that fortunate Prince a legitimate Issue to succeed him; that blessed Prince looks down from Heaven, and beholds the tears of the Priests, and looks upon the breach of their Priviledges, which he kept inviolable, as an affront put on himself. Afford also this assistance to your Brother of blessed memory, as to rectifie what he did by other mens Councils rather than his own; and conceal that action of his, which he was ignorant was so displeasing to the Senate; for it appears now, that therefore the Ambassadors we sent were debarr'd his presence, lest the publick determination might come to his knowledg. It is for the honour of the past transactions, that you make no scruple to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolish that, which we will make appear, was no act of that Princes.</p>

                                 <p>Three things the most excellent Prefect of the City hath made use of in his Relation, upon which he lays the greatest stress of his Defence; that <hi>Rome,</hi> as he says, is an humble suppliant for the retrival of her ancient Rites, that it is injustice to alienate the Patrimony of the Priests, and the <hi>Vestal</hi> Virgins; and that when the attempt was made, there hapned a general Famine. In the first Proposition the Venerable <hi>Metropolis</hi> of the Empire is introduc'd, cover'd with tears, and expressing her griefs in a passionate and perswasive Oration, requiring the Restoration, as he makes her speak of her pristine Ceremonies, for that this was the Religion that exp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Why did they suffer thems<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

As for the <hi>Gauls</hi> to what purpose is it to speak of them, whom the shattered relicks of the <hi>Roman</hi> Forces had never been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to have oppos'd, had not their Enemies been betrayed by the noise of the affrighted Geese? See what Guardians are deputed to the Charge and Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition of the <hi>Roman</hi> Temples. Where was your ador'd <hi>Jupiter</hi> at that time? Was it he who in the shape of a Goose called <hi>Manlius</hi> to the rescue of the Capitol? but why should I deny, that the Heathen Rites have given assistance to the <hi>Roman</hi> Arms? For even <hi>Hannibal</hi> himself worship'd the same mock-Deities. Let them therefore choose which they will own, if the Heathen Ceremonies were triumphant in the <hi>Roman</hi> Conquest, they were overcome and baffled in the <hi>Carthaginians;</hi> if the men of <hi>Carthage</hi> by the assistance of their gods got the Victory, what advantages did the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire receive from the same tuition? Let therefore that invidious Complaint of the <hi>Roman</hi> People be stifled, that great City never issued out any such Commission; but with greater reason addresses her self to her Children in a far different harangue.</p>

                                    <q>To what purpose do you tire me with your multiplyed Sacrifices, and dye me with the blood of the innocent Herd? The Trophies and Signs of Victory are not legible in the Fibres of a Beast, but in the courages of the <hi>Militia;</hi> I used other methods of Discipline, when I put on Lawrel for the conquest of the World. It was the valour of <hi>Camillus,</hi> that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated that triumphant Army, which had taken possession of your Walls and the Fortifications of the Capitol, and retrived those Standards which the Gods themselves could not defend, and those whom Religion was too weak to affright, his bravery destroyed. Why should I remark the atchiev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Attilius Regulus,</hi> who conquer'd for the <hi>Romans</hi> by dying for them? <hi>Scipio Africanus</hi> won his glory not by lying prostrate before the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars in the Capitol, but by charging the Troops of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and reaping Triumphs with his Sword. Tell me not that these were the observances of the Antients, I hate those Ceremonies that were used by the <hi>Nero's.</hi> Why should I mention those Emperors whose Reign was of no longer dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than a month or two, and whose Funerals immediately succeeded their assuming the Royal Purple? Or is that a new thing, that the <hi>Barbarians</hi>
                                       <pb n="383" facs="tcp:49523:253"/> have deserted their own Habitations to make Irruptions into the <hi>Roman</hi> Territories? Were those Emperors Christians, when by an unparallel'd but miserable example, the Father wore Chains in <hi>Persia,</hi> while his Son trampled on the Liberties of the Senate and People, and gave mankind a Specimen, that the promises of Victory which the <hi>Augurs</hi> made them, were vain and fallacious?

You are suppliants to the Emperors, that they would be favourable to your Gods, but we are Petitioners to the Son of God, that he would be propitious to the Emperor; you first make a God, and then adore it, but we think it a great injury to the Deity to imagine, that that must be accounted a God, which owes its being to a man. God is not willing to be worship'd in Images cut in stone; nay your very Philosophers make a sport of such ridiculous obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances.

And while you refuse to believe that Christ could dye, do you not by this very obstinacy do honor to him?</p>
                                 <p>But the antient Altars (as he goes on) ought to be restor'd to the Images, the ornaments to the Temples. Let them tender such a Petition to an Heathen Prince, a Christian Emperor knows no honor due to any but the Altar of <hi>Christ Jesus.</hi> Why do they compel the hands and mouths of holy men to administer to the promotion of their sacrilegious Designs? Let the Tongue of our Prince be employed in re-sounding the Praises of his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and celebrate him only, whose goodness he experiments, because <hi>the heart of the King is in the hand of God.</hi> Did ever any of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:49523:254"/> Emperors erect an Altar to Christ? While therefore they Petition for the Restoration of what was formerly theirs, they give the Christian Emperors an encouragement by their example to consider, what deference they ought to pay to the Religion, which they profess, while the <hi>Gentiles</hi> postpone all things to their Superstition. While we have begun, let us go on; we (being excluded) glory in our Sufferings, they are troubled at their losses, and what they account an injury, we reckon among our Trophies; they never did us greater honors or favors, than when they past their Edicts, that all the Servants of Christ should be scourg'd, should be banish'd, should be martyr'd; what their infidelity thought a punishment, that Religion turn'd into a blessing; view those men of invincible courage, and you'll find our belief has been encreas'd and propagated by Injuries, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, and death it self, while they are perswaded, that unless their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion be maintained by the publick, it can no longer continue in being.</p>
                                 <p>Let, sayes he, the <hi>Vestal</hi> Virgins enjoy their Immunities. Let those discourse at that rate, who cannot be convinc'd, that Virginity may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served without a recompence to incourage the undertaking, let those give Money to maintain Chastity, who distrust the strength of their Virtue. And yet what is the number of those Virgins, who are thus hired to maintain their Purity? When you reckon all that are admitted Vestals, you can scarce find seven who have taken the Vows upon them; and yet these are the multitude of Votaries, who are known to be of this Society by the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar dress of their heads, by the pompousness of their Purple Robes, by their numerous attendants on each side of their Chaires, by their great Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, and their rich Revenues, and by a set number of years, which they are obliged to consecrate to Virginity; let them but seriously contemplate, and look on our Professors, they may see all Ages, Sexes, and Qualities in love with Modesty, Chastity, and Virginity; the curius fillettings of their hair is far from being an ornament of their heads, let them put on a coarse Vail, that may become famous by its serviceableness to the interests of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity; a Virgin is then best adorn'd, not when she strives to augment, but when she slights the charms of her beauty, 'tis not the richness of their Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, nor the delicacies of Luxury, but frequent Fastings, and continued Mortifications, that give a lustre to their performances, not their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, not their Revenues; to conclude, all the Practices of our Virgins are such, that you would think the design of advancing Chastity is rather hindered and restrained, while the Duties of it are exercised; but on the contrary, while the Offices of Chastity are performed, the study of it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted; for Chastity is truly advanc'd by that, which to you seems to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy it. She is not a Virgin, who is sway'd by profit, not by the Dictates of Virtue to be so, nor is that true purity, which must be purchas'd for such or such a time, by those that will offer most to maintain it. The first Victory that true Chastity makes, is to subdue the love of Money, for covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness is the greatest Enemy to, and most potent supplanter of modesty.</p>
                                 <p>But let us take it for granted, that the Virgins ought to be maintained at the charge of the Publick; how shall the Christian Votaries be taken care of, what Exchequer shall be sufficient to provide for them? Or if they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that these endowments are the peculiar Patrimony of the Vestals, are they not asham'd, who usurp'd the whole income under the Heathen Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, not to permit us to be sharers with them under those who are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians? They also make complaints that the Priests, and other Officers of Religion are not provided for at the publick Charge, and want that Alimony
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:49523:254"/> which is their due; and upon this subject what a noise, what a multitude of complaints disturb our ears? While on the contrary by some late made Laws, the Religious among us are denied the priviledge of being infeof'd in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Patrimonies, and no man complains, for we never reckon such things as injuries, because we are never troubled at our loss. If any man, being a Priest, plead his priviledge, thereby to be exempt from secular Offices, he must upon that account renounce his whole Estate, both what was deriv'd to him from his Ancestors, and what was the product of his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry.</p>

But it is objected, that whatever has been given, or bequeath'd to the Church, hath not been violated; and let themselves tell us, whoever robbed and took away such endowments from their Temples, when yet the Christian Church hath been a sufferer in that kind. And if such things had been done to the Gentiles, it had been rather a requital of an old, than a doing of a new injury; and do they now at length complain of their hard usage, and demand Equity? Where was this Equity then, when the poor Christians after they were strip'd of their Estates, were denied also the very priviledge of Life, and by a piece of unpractised barbarity, were debar'd the benefit of Sepulture, which was every man's birthright? While those whom the Gentiles tumbled headlong into the Sea, the Waves more kind than their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors, brought back again to the shore in order to their Interment. And this also is a new Victory of our Faith, that they themselves now condemn those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane Actions of their Ancestors: and (with shame to them be it spoken) what reason is there that they should beg the continuance of their Offices, whose actions they condemn. And yet after all, no man ever yet denied the Temples their Offerings, or the Priests their Legacies; their Lands only are taken away from them, because what they held by the title of Religion, they used only to irreligious purposes. They who plead our example for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying such Estates, why do they not also dispose of them to such good ends
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:49523:255"/> as we do? The Church hath no Patrimony but her Faith, that is her Rent, that her Income; the Lands of the Church are the Possessions of the Poor.</p>

The Estate is taken from them, but put to the right use. Behold this is the Crime, this the Sacriledge which Heaven is said to be angry for, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing less than a publick Famine can expiate, because whatever serv'd to advance the interests of the Priests, was the cause of general advantages to the People.</p>

                                 <p>The last, and most cogent Argument is yet left for a reserve, whether you, O Emperor, are not bound in Honour and Conscience to restore those Endowments, which have prov'd so beneficial to your selves; for, <hi>says he,</hi> let the gods be your Guardians, and let us have the liberty to adore them. This is that, O most Christian Princes, which we cannot endure, because they upbraid us with the Sacrifices they offer to their Deities for your wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, and against your Commands commit the most notorious Sacriledge, taking your connivance for consent. Let them keep their titular Deities to themselves, let them, if they be able, defend their own Votaries, and if they want power to protect their bigotted Proselytes, how can it be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, they should superintend your Affairs, who slight their Worship?</p>
                                 <p>But, <hi>says he,</hi> we ought in civility to maintain those Rites, which our fore-fathers establisht, and why so? is it because all things grow to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, as they grow in years? Was not the World at first one confused and indigested <hi>Chaos,</hi> in which all lay huddled together without form and order, and did it not look beautiful when the hand of God made a separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between Heaven, Earth, and Sea, and confin'd each within its proper bounds? When the Earth being newly risen out of its moist bed of darkness, wondered to see a bright Sun darting its benign and enlightning Beams up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it. Even in the ordinary course of nature the day is usher'd in with an ambiguous light, and by degrees the Sun gets strength enough, both to enlighten and to warm the World. The Moon it self, the properest Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme of the Church in the sacred Oracles, grows by degrees to its fulness, for renewing her light once every Month, at first the shadows of the night are too strong for it, and eclipse its splendor, but when a few dayes have fill'd her sharp pointed horns, and she lives at a distance from the Sun, she gives the night the assistances of her Beams, which supply the want of the day. The old World was ignorant of Tillage, but when once they began to understand the Art of Husbandry, and saw the face of ths Earth co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour'd with Corn, and the rude soyl clad with Vineyards, how easily did they, who observ'd it could be manur'd, put off their old bruitish manners, and leave them for the civill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Nay the Spring it self, which inclines mankind to a correspondence with nature, in process of time is covered with Leaves, that are ready to drop from the Trees, and brings forth later Fruits. And is it not so with mankind also, who in our infancy have the thoughts, and pursue the delights of Children, but when we grow to maturity, are ashamed of such impertinencies? If all things therefore must continue as they were at the beginning, then we have reason to be angry, that the Word broke from its dark Prison, to which it was confin'd, and exerted it self into the Region of Light, and Visibility. And is it not a nobler acquisition to set the understanding free from the night of ignorance, than to rescue the Earth from shadows and obscurity? and do not the Beams of Truth shine more benignly upon the mind, than the Rayes of the Sun upon the Eyes?

For that man cannot expect the Crown of Victory, who has no Adversaries. Whereas the sacred verities justly grew famous by baffling the Opinions that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd their admittance.</p>
                                 <p>If only the ancient Ceremonies are pleasing, why did <hi>Rome</hi> her self change her Rites of Worship? I omit to remark how the History of after ages alter'd their ancient course manner of living, by changing their homely Cottages into stately and pompous Edifices, why, that I may answer to the point, did they, who were fondly in love with every new Religion, admit the gods of their conquer'd Cities, together with their own triumphant Deities, and their foreign Rites into their Temples? How comes it to pass, that the goddess <hi>Cybele</hi> washes her Chariots in the River <hi>Almon,</hi> in imitation of what is done by the Priests in <hi>Phrygia?</hi> Why have we fetch'd Priests out of that Country to attend her Altars, and enfranchiz'd the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Deities who were always lookt on as Enemies to our grandeur? The goddess, which the <hi>Africans</hi> call <hi>Urania,</hi> the <hi>Persians Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra,</hi> but most others worship under the name of <hi>Venus,</hi> is the same Deity under divers denominations. And so was <hi>Victory</hi> lookt on as a goddess too, which is only a blessing given from above, but has no Empire of her own, and depends more upon the strength of Armies, than on the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of Religion. That certainly therefore must needs be a venerable and potent goddess, who ows her very Being to the numbers of an Army, and the event of a Battel.</p>
                                 <p>The Altar of this Goddess is petition'd for, that it may be new erected in the Court of the <hi>Roman</hi> City. <hi>i. e.</hi> in that very place, where great throngs of Christians daily meet; every Temple hath its Altars, and there is an Altar in the Temple of <hi>Victory;</hi> because they delight in multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, they every where offer their Sacrifices. What is this therefore but to trample upon the Christian Rites, while they are so earnest to restore the oblations upon this Altar. And can that be suffered, that a Heathen should offer his Sacrifices where a Christian is present? Let all who are present, says he, though against their wills expose their Eyes to be blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the fumes, their Ears to be polluted with the profane Musick, their Throats to be cramm'd with the Ashes of the burnt-Offerings, their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strils infected with the odours, and their Faces, though turn'd the other way, cov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Are they not satisfied, that our publick Baths, our Portico's and Streets are filled with the Images of their gods? And shall not the condition of every Person that hath a place in that Common-council be equal? Shall that part of the Senate, who have embrac'd Christianity, have their Consciences impos'd upon by the asseverations of those that make Protestations, and the Oaths of those that sware at that Altar? If they oppose such proceedings, they shall appear to betray a lye, and if they acquiesce, they shall countenance the Sacriledge. <hi>Where,</hi> says he, <hi>shall we swear to observe your Laws
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:49523:256"/> and Sanctions?</hi> Must therefore your determinations, which are included in the Laws, want a Confirmation from the Ceremonies of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to oblige to fidelity, not only those that are present, but those also that are absent? And what is more, O most sacred Emperors, your own honour is affronted, for you compel, if you command such things.</p>
                                 <p>The August Emperor <hi>Constantius</hi> of venerable memory, being not yet made a Christian by Baptism, thought himself polluted, should he but see that Altar; he commanded it to be taken away, not to be restored; that action of his carryed its Authority, and Vindication with it; But this hath nothing of imperial Sanction to plead for it self; let no man please him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self because this is wanting, for a man may be trulier said to be present, who is conversant with our minds, than he who is the object of our corporeal eyes; for the nearest Ʋnion is that of Souls, not of Bodies. The Senate meets only on the Summons of your Writ, and to you they swear fealty, not to the imaginary Deities; your Interests they prefer to their own, and Childrens welfare, but not to their Religion. This is a Charity highly to be desir'd, and of more value than the Power you enjoy, as long as Religion and Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is preserved, which are the security of your Empire.</p>
                                 <p>But perhaps it may move some to distrust, that so pious a Prince, [as <hi>Gratian</hi>] was so deserted and betray'd, as if the value of mens Merits must be estimated according to his present adverse Fortune; for what wise man is there, who hath not sufficiently experimented, that all humane Affairs run round in a Circle, and fall under various chances with respect to success, fortune never continuing kind to the same Person? Was there ever a more fortunate man than <hi>Cneius Pompey,</hi> who went into the World under the Protection of the <hi>Roman</hi> Deities? And yet at last, when he had worn Lawrel for the Conquest of three parts of the World, being baffled, routed, and banish'd beyond the limits of his own Empire, he fell by the hand of an infamous <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Eunuch. Could the <hi>Eastern</hi> part of the World ever boast of a more puissant Prince than <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and yet he, when he had tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph'd over all his Enemies, and yet spar'd the Subjects of his Victories, lost his life and honor at last by the assaults of a Woman? and that very King, who allowed his conquered Adversaries the liberty of Princes, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his head cut off, and thrown into a Vessel filled with blood, became the scorn of Female Pride, which bid him <hi>satiate himself with what he lov'd.</hi> So great a difference and variety is there in the lives and fortunes of such men. Was there ever any man a more exact and punctual Religionist, than the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Captain <hi>Hamilcar,</hi> who in the midst of his Squadron, even during the Engagement, continually made his Oblations, and when he saw his Party routed, threw himself into the fire which he had kindled, that he might with his blood extinguish those flames, which he found too sadly to his cost were no way instrumental to make him victorious? To what purpose shall I mention <hi>Julian,</hi> who giving too easie credit to the Responses of the <hi>Augurs,</hi> depriv'd himself of the opportunity of returning out of <hi>Persia.</hi> Therefore the same kind of Suffering is not alwayes the effect of the same sort of Crime.

But he found not things to answer his Expectations; for having opened his School, he perceived 'twas the custom for Students to flock a pace to a new Master, but after a while to desert him, and run to another, and thereby defraud him of his Sallary. This gave him enough of <hi>Rome,</hi> and it was not long before divine Providence opened a better way for him. For Orders being come from the Court at <hi>Milan</hi> to the Provost of <hi>Rome,</hi> to provide a fit Person to be Professor of Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick at <hi>Milan,</hi> and to send him thither at the publick Charge, <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus,</hi> who had before particularly taken notice of him, pitched upon <hi>Augustin,</hi> and sent him thither, where he arriv'd about the year CCCLXXXIV. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> who knew how to value a Scholar, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cast his eye upon him, and entertain'd him with singular kindness and humanity, which made no small impression upon him. He duly attended S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> his Sermons, not out of any desire he had to be instructed in Matters of Faith, but out of curiosity to take the just measures of his Eloquence, whether it answered the Renown which fame had spread abroad concerning it. However he was caught when he least designed it, the holy man's Discourses making their way by continual droppings, till they reduc'd him to a right mind, and brought him off from all the lewdnesses of his former Life. One of the first steps towards his Conversion, was his renouncing <hi>Manichaeism,</hi> and having got his foot out of that snare, he went over to the <hi>Platonists,</hi> entring his name among the <hi>Academick</hi> Sect, a Tribe of Philosophers of greatest vogue at that time. But he found no satisfaction there, and shortly after wrote against them. His Mother impatient of his absence, and passionately desirous of his wellfare, was in the mean time come to <hi>Milan,</hi> where by her Prayers and Tears, by her Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions both in publick and private, she ceased not to solicit Heaven for a happy success, and now she found the good effect of what a grave Bishop had long since told her,<note n="e" place="margin">Confess. l. <hi>3.</hi> c. ult. col. <hi>89.</hi>
                        </note> when she unweariedly importun'd him to discourse her Son, in order to the reclaiming of him, <hi>go thy way</hi> (said he) <hi>and compose thy self, for 'tis not possible that a Son of such tears should perish.</hi> An answer which she receiv'd with a profound reverence, as if it had been an Oracle drop'd from Heaven. Great pains S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> had taken with him, and he had been plied with the Councils of good old <hi>Simplician,</hi> but still the Crown of this great man's Conversion was reserv'd for the more immediate hand of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.

Immediately he heard a shrill voice in a kind of melody oft ecchoing to him, <hi>take up the Book
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:49523:258"/> and read.</hi> He did so, and the first place he cast his eye upon, was that of S. <hi>Paul; Not in riotting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envy; but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh to fulfill the Lusts thereof.</hi> He read thus far, and shut to the Book, and on a sudden all his dark thoughts vanish'd, and a light of joy and comfort overspread his mind. And now he resolv'd to quit his profession of Rhetorick, and intirely to devote himself to Christianity, and having continued two years in the state of a <hi>Catechumen,</hi> he was baptiz'd by S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> (which he was wont to glory in as no small part of his honour) and together with him his Son <hi>Adeodatus</hi> (whom he had by a Concubine that he kept) a Youth of fifteen years of Age, but of that prodigious for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness, that his Father stood amaz d<note n="g" place="margin">Horrori mihi erat illud in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genium, &amp; quis praeter te t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The Provost began calmly to perswade the Catholicks to quit however the <hi>Portian</hi> Church, but the People would not hear of it, so he went back to give an Account to the Emperor, S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> in the mean while entertaining the People with an Oration against <hi>Aux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entius,</hi> wherein he gives them an account of what had pass'd, and the attempts of <hi>Auxentius</hi> and his Party. The next day, being Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, after Sermon the <hi>Catechumens</hi> being dismiss'd, he was gone to the <hi>Baptistery</hi> to baptize the <hi>Competentes</hi> that stood Candidates for that Ordinance; when he was told, that Officers were sent from Court to the <hi>Portian</hi> Church, that they had hung up Curtains, and that a great many of the People was flocking thither: He nothing mov'd, went on with the Divine Service, but before he had done, he was acquainted, that the People having met with <hi>Castulus</hi> an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Presbyter in the Street, had in a great rage laid hands upon him, and 'twas to be fear'd what might be the effect of an intemperate Zeal. Hereat the good man was truly troubled, and with Prayers and Tears besought God, that no mans Blood might be spilt in this quarrel, but that rather his own might be shed, not only for his Friends, but Enemies; and immediately he dispatcht away some Presbyters and Deacons, who recovered the man safe out of the hands of the People. The report of this Accident made a great noise at Court, and the louder we may be sure by being handed by inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate Enemies. And now Warrants are sent out for apprehending, and arraigning several Persons, which fell first upon the society of Merchants and Tradesmen, and at this holy time (for 'twas now the great <hi>Passion-week</hi>) which was wont to be honoured with the release of Prisoners, nothing was heard but the ratling of Chains, and the requiring vast Sums of Money in a little time; which many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd they were ready to pay, and as much more if they pleas'd, so they might but be suffered to enjoy the Faith. By this time the Prisons were full of Tradesmen, and the Magistrates and men of Quality severely threatned, if the Church was not presently deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered up: The Persecution grew hot, and had the Church doors been set open, things had run into the utmost extremity of cruelty and confusion. The Commanders and Officers in the mean time treated
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:49523:260"/> with S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> about this Affair, urging him with the Imperial Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, that the Emperor in whose Power all things were, did but demand his Right: He replyed, <q>Did the Emperor demand any thing of mine, my Land or my Money, I would not oppose him, but those things that immediately belong to God are not subject to the Authority of the Emperor: If it be my Patrimony you seek, take it; if my Person, I am here ready for you. Have you a mind to hurry me to Prison, or to death? 'Twill be a kindness to me. I will not I assure you engarrison my self within crowds of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, nor fly to the Altar to save my Life, but rather willingly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it up for the Altars sake.</q> So heartily did the good man desire to prevent the shedding of Blood, and those quarrels and combusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that were likely not only to ruine <hi>Milan,</hi> but perhaps <hi>Italy</hi> it self, which he was freely content to have redeem'd with the loss of his own Life. And espying some Officers of the <hi>Goths</hi> among the rest, he ask'd them, whether the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire had taken them in, to be the Incendiaries of the publick Peace? If these parts were ruined, whither would they go to find entertainment? Then they requir'd of him to reduce and quiet the Multitude. He told them, 'twas in his Power not to set them on work, 'twas in God's only to calm and pacifie them, but if they lookt upon him as the spring of the motion, they ought to proceed against him, either by death or banishment.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. WITH this answer they departed, leaving him in the Church, where he continued all day, and at night went home, that he might be ready, if they came to apprehend him. Early the next morning before break of day, as he was going out of doors, he found the Church guarded by Souldiers, who yet had plainly told the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, that he might go abroad, if he pleas'd, they were ready to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend him, if he went to Church with the Catholicks; if not, they were resolved to go to that place, wheresoever <hi>Ambrose</hi> kept his Congregation. 'Twas a dangerous time, and the <hi>Arians</hi> wisely kept themselves within doors, having no great Party among the Citizens, but few of the Court, and some <hi>Goths;</hi> the main body of them fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the motion of the Empress. While the Lessons were read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he was told, that the People were assembled at the <hi>New</hi> Church, and that the Congregation was fuller than ever it had been in the most peaceable times, and that a Reader was call'd for. The Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers that were set to guard the Church, understanding the Bishop had ordered them to be excluded all Communion, came into the Church, whereat when the People, especially the weaker sex were affrighted, they bad them not be afraid, they were come thither to pray, not to fight. The People however call'd upon him to go to the other Church, where the Congregation did earnestly expect and desire his Company. Then taking for his Argument the Lessons that had been read out of <hi>Job,</hi> he discoursed to them very apposite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the present circumstances of things, with what admirable cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and patience they had discharg'd themselves, how vigorously he had born up against all the temptations of <hi>Satan</hi> and his Agents, and the several attempts which the abusers of the Royal Authority had made upon him. Next he proceeded to explain a passage read that morning out of the <hi>Psalms, O God the Heathen are come into
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:49523:261"/> thine Inheritance,</hi> which he applyed to the case in hand, especially to the <hi>Goths,</hi> and some other barbarous Peoples seizing upon the Church. He hop'd that in this time by the intercession of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and Officers, and by the supplications of the People, the edge of the Emperors zeal might be taken off, when 'twas told him, that a Notary was come with Orders from the Emperor, with whom he went aside to receive his message, which thus began. What came into your mind <hi>(said he)</hi> thus to act contrary to Command? What was commanded <hi>(replyed the Bishop)</hi> or what has been thus rashly acted, I know not. Why <hi>(said the Notary)</hi> did you send your Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters into the Church? I desire to know whether you intend to usurp the Empire, that I may know how to prepare to deal with you. <hi>Ambrose</hi> answered, that he had done nothing in prejudice of the Church, that when he heard the Souldiers had seiz'd it, he had only entertained the news of it with a sigh, many had urged him to go thither, but he told them, I cannot deliver up the Church, and I may not fight for it; but that as soon as he understood that the Curtains which had been put up in the Church for the Emperor's apartment were taken down (which in truth the Boyes in wantonness had torn in pieces) he had sent thither his Presbyters, but refus'd to go himself, (though the People press'd him to it) saying, I hope in Christ, the Emperor himself will be on our side: That if this was Tyranny, he had Arms indeed, but only in Christ's name, power to offer his Body to the Sword; and if he thought him a Tyrant, why did he delay to strike? That 'twas even proverbial, that <hi>Emperors were more desirous of the Priesthood, than Priests of Empire;</hi> and Christ himself ran away, when they would have made him King; that he had his Tyranny 'tis true, but such as lay in weakness, according to that of the Apostle, <hi>when I am weak, then am I strong;</hi> that <hi>Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imus</hi> himself would not accuse him of Tyranny towards <hi>Valentinian,</hi> while he confess'd with some regret, 'twas by the power of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassage he had been kept from invading <hi>Italy;</hi> adding, that Bishops had never play'd the Tyrants, but had often suffered very hard things from them. The day was spent in mourning and sadness, and the Bishop forc'd to lodge in the Church all night, the Souldiers guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it so close, that none was suffered to go out, so they pass'd the time in singing Psalms. The next day, being Passion-day, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of <hi>Jonah</hi> was read in course, several parcels whereof he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded and applyed, and was upon that, that if the Prophet had so much pity on the short-liv'd Gourd, how much more should God have of so great a City, and that therefore he had remov'd the Judgment from it; when word was brought him, that the Guards were commanded off the Church, and the several Summs that had been exacted of the Tradesmen ordered to be restored. The whole City hereupon put on a new face, and every corner was full of glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and joyful Acclamations, the Souldiers running up and down with the good News, and going up to the Altar, did by their kisses signifie the publick peace. S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> though sharing in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon joy, had reason to fear, that as to himself the storm was not yet quite blown over. He knew he was traduc'd at Court as a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and when the great Officers prest the Emperor to comply with the Petition of the Souldiers, and to go to Church, he had answered
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:49523:261"/> with some passion, <hi>I believe if</hi> Ambrose <hi>should command it, you would deliver me up to be a Prisoner.</hi> Words that presag'd no kind intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towards him, but that 'twas evident, who 'twas that blew up the Coals. Nay <hi>Calligonus</hi> the Eunuch chief Gentleman of the Bed-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, than whom none better understood the Intreagues at Court, told <hi>Ambrose</hi> to his face, <hi>dare you presume, while I live, to affront the Emperor? I'le take off your Head.</hi> Whereto the holy man replyed, <hi>God Almighty, if he please, suffer you to make good your threatnings, I'le suffer as becomes a Bishop, do you what becomes an Eunuch: But from such God d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Forthwith tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him the Officers of the Church, and the Persons that waited there for imposition of hands, he commanded them to dig before the rails that encompast the Tombs of S. <hi>Felix</hi> and S. <hi>Nabor</hi> the Martyrs; nor had they dug far, when apparent signs shew'd themselves, and at last they discovered the bodies of two proper Persons, their bones in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, and both Corps all fresh besprinkled with blood, the head only of one severed from the body. These proved to be the bodies of S. <hi>Protasius,</hi> and <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

For two whole dayes the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple crowded to behold the relicks of those venerable Martyrs, after which in the evening they remov'd them first into the Church of S. <hi>Fausta,</hi> where they watched all night, the next day they translated them into the <hi>Ambrosian</hi> Church, and God was pleas'd to honour the Solemnity with very signal Miracles. For one <hi>Severus</hi> a Butcher, who had been blind for many years, and by reason thereof had been forc'd to give over his Trade, and was maintain'd at the charge of several charitable Persons, a man known to the whole City, hearing the bustle made in the Procession, enquired what it was, and being told, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded himself to be led thither, and pray'd he might but touch the Bier with his Handkerchief, which being done, he no sooner apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to his Eyes, but immediately he recovered his sight. Several that were possess'd with evil Spirits, upon their touching the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs Bodies, found themselves rid of their Tyrannical Inmates, and return'd home well. Towels and Handkercheifs were brought and
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:49523:262"/> laid upon the Bodies, and many who did but touch the Cloaths where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Martyrs were wrapt, were presently cured of their Infirmities and Distempers. The truth of which Miracles are abundantly justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by S. <hi>Ambros<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And I make no doubt but God suffered these Miracles to be wrought at this time on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to confront the <hi>Arian</hi> impieties, and to give the highest and most uncontroulable attestation to the truth of the Catholick Cause, so mightily at this time oppos'd, traduc'd, and persecuted. Indeed the <hi>Arians</hi> were strangely netled at it, and knowing no better way to evade the force of the Evidence, denyed that they were Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, and when that would not do, boldly denyed matter of Fact, that ever any such miraculous effects had been wrought, when as the Persons upon whom they had been wrought were at hand, and in the common view of all. A greater piece of infidelity (as S. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi> observes) than that of the very Devils that were cast out, who believed and trembled; the Devil confessing, what the <hi>Arians</hi> did deny. Nay they gave out<note n="k" place="margin">Paulin. ibid.</note>, that <hi>Ambrose</hi> had hired Persons for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, to feign themselves possess'd, and to say that the evil Spirits were tormented by the Martyrs. But Heaven soon confuted this malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous insinuation. For on a sudden one in the Crowd was seized with an evil Spirit, and cryed out, that they were really tormented in the same way that he was, and that this should be the Portion of those that disowned the Martyrs, and disclaim'd the Catholick Doctrine. The <hi>Arians</hi> confounded with this Testimony, had no other way but to endeavour to stifle it, to which end they got the man into their hands, privately murdered him, and threw him into a Fish-pond. But to return.</p>
                     <p n="8">VIII. THE Corps being brought into the <hi>Ambrosian</hi> Church, and the fame of the Miracles noys'd abroad, S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> went into the Pulpit, and preach'd<note n="l" place="margin">Ext. Serm. ubi supr. Ep. LXXXV.</note> to them upon that occasion, taking for his Argument the former part of the XIX. Psalm then read; <hi>The Heavens declare the Glory of God, &amp;c.</hi> which he manag'd suitable to that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity. The Sermon ended, he would have proceeded to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terment of the Bodies, but the People unanimously besought him, it might be deferr'd till the next Lord's day; at length it was agreed it should be done the next day, when S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> preacht<note n="m" place="margin">Serm.

So the holy Martyrs were deposited in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, and laid up in expectation of a glorious Resurrection. And though <hi>Baronius</hi> to justifie those Reliques of these Martyrs, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> shews at this day, says<note n="n" place="margin">Ann. <hi>387.</hi> T. <hi>4.</hi> p. <hi>546.</hi> vid.</note> more than once, that S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> reserv'd part of them both for himself, and for the use and ornament of other Churches.<note n="o" place="margin">Not. ad Mart.

                        </note> readily undertook the journey, and arriving at <hi>Triers,</hi> where <hi>Maximus</hi> resided, the next day went to Court. He was met by a <hi>French</hi> Eunuch, chief Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of the Bed-chamber, of whom he demanded, that he might have audience. The Eunuch ask'd whether he had any credential Letters, the Bishop replyed he had. Whereupon the other acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, that he could not be admitted but in <hi>Consistory,</hi> or the place of publick audience. He answered, that was not the way, wherein
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:49523:263"/> Bishops were wont to be treated, and that he had Affairs of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance that were to be privately communicated to his Prince. Then he went in to acquaint his Master, but brought back no other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, to which the Bishop rejoyn'd, that this way of treatment was unsuitable to the Character that he bore, however he was resolv'd not to be wanting to the business he had undertaken, and was glad he had an opportunity of making his particular Concerns stoop to the interest both of his living, and his deceased Prince. <hi>Maximus</hi> being sat in Council, <hi>Ambrose</hi> was introduc'd, at whose coming in, the Prince rose up to give him the kiss, according to the usual salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Bishops and great men in those times. But <hi>Ambrose</hi> stood still among the Councellors, who perswaded him to go up nearer to the Throne, telling him the Emperor call'd him. What Discourse pass'd between them, was in this ensuing Dialogue. <q>
                           <hi>AMBROSE.</hi> I wonder you should offer the kiss to one whom you do not own, for if you did, you would not give me Audience in this place. <hi>MAXIMƲS.</hi> Bishop, you seem to be much in passion. <hi>AMBR.</hi> I am more ashamed than angry, to see my self in so unsuitable a place. <hi>MAXIM.</hi> At your first Embassy you came into the <hi>Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story. AMBR.</hi> That was no fault of mine, 'twas his that summon'd me, not mine, that came in. <hi>MAX.</hi> Why then did you come in at all? <hi>AMBR.</hi> Because I then came to require peace from you as an inferior, now, it seems, as an equal. <hi>MAX.</hi> How do you mean equal? <hi>AMBR.</hi> By the favour of Almighty God, who did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give, but has preserved the Empire to <hi>Valentinian. MAX.</hi> You have impos'd upon me, and so has <hi>Bauto,</hi> who under pretence of securing the young Emperor, sought to transfer the Empire to himself, and to that end sent an Army of barbarous People against me, as if I had not Forces enough to oppose against him, having so many thousands of those barbarous Nations constantly under my pay. And had not I then been detain'd, when you came upon that Embassy, who could have oppos'd me, or have stop'd the course of my Victory? <hi>Ambr.</hi> Be not angry, Sir, there is no cause for it, but calmly hear my reply. I am come, because you complain, that whilst you hearkned to me at my first Embassy, you were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by me. But I account it an honour to undergoe all this for the sake of an Orphan Prince. For whom should we that are Bishops defend, if not Orphans? It being commanded by the Law of our Religion, <hi>judge the Fatherless, plead for the Widow, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the oppressed:</hi> And elsewhere, <hi>he is a Father of the Fatherless, and a Judge of the Widows.</hi> But I intend not to reproach <hi>Valenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> with my good Offices. To come to the point; where did I ever oppose your Army, and hinder your passage into <hi>Italy?</hi> What Rocks did I throw in your way? What Forces? What Legions did I encounter you with? Did I with my body stop up the <hi>Alps,</hi> and render them unpassable to you? I would it were in my power so to do, I should not fear any complaints or objections you could make against it. With what promises did I ever delude you, to make you consent to a Peace? Did not you your self send Count <hi>Victor,</hi> whom I met not far from <hi>Mentz,</hi> to desire Peace? How then did <hi>Valentinian</hi> deceive you, from whom your self first prayed Peace, before ever he sent to demand it? In what was it that
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:49523:264"/>
                           <hi>Bauto</hi> beguil'd you, while he only testified his care and fidelity to his Master? Was it that he did not betray his Prince? What was it wherein I circumvented you? At my first arrival, when you said that <hi>Valentinian</hi> ought to come to you as a Son to his Father, I replyed, it was not reasonable that an Infant Prince with his Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow Mother should pass the <hi>Alps</hi> in the extremities of Winter, and to do it without her, was in that juncture of Affairs to run the greatest hazard; that our Embassy was only for Peace, not to undertake for the Emperor's coming, nor could I engage for what was not within my Commission, and sure I am, I never did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise any thing in that matter, so that your self said, let us wait and see what answer <hi>Victor</hi> will bring with him, who while I staid with you, arrived at <hi>Milan;</hi> where his demands were reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and he was told, Peace was the business sought on both sides, and not the Emperor's journey, who could not stir; and I was present at his return. How then did I hinder <hi>Valentinian?</hi> After this, Embassadors were dispatch'd into <hi>France</hi> to deny them passage, and they met me at <hi>Valentia</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and at my return, I found the passages of the <hi>Alps</hi> guarded by both Parties. How did I then divert your Armies? What Troops of yours hindred I from going into <hi>Italy?</hi> What <hi>Barbarians</hi> did <hi>Count Bauto</hi> send against you? Though it had been no wonder if he being by Nation a <hi>Barbarian</hi> had done it, when you your self threaten'd the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire with your barbarous Forces, whom you keep in pay with the Money that's usually levied upon the Provinces. See now the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between your fierce threats, and the sweetness of the young Emperor <hi>Valentinian?</hi> Nothing would satisfie you, but with your <hi>Barbarian</hi> Troops to break in upon <hi>Italy,</hi> while <hi>Valentinian</hi> diverted the <hi>Hunns</hi> and the <hi>Alani,</hi> who were coming down through <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> to fall upon <hi>Gaul.</hi> And wherein had <hi>Bauto</hi> been to blame, if he had set the <hi>Barbarians</hi> together by the ears? For while you made your self Master of the <hi>Roman</hi> Forces, and he on the other side prepares on all hands to defend himself, the <hi>Juthungi</hi> in the mean time wast the Country of the <hi>Grizons</hi> in the very heart of the Empire, and to suppress these <hi>Juthungi</hi> are the <hi>Hunns</hi> call'd in, who when they were upon their march, and near at hand, were forc'd to retire, and desert their intended Conquest, that you might not be alarm'd and disturb'd. Compare the case; you cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Country of the <hi>Grizons</hi> to be wasted, <hi>Valentinian</hi> with his own money purchas'd your Peace. Behold your own Brother, that stands there at your right hand, whom, when <hi>Valentinian</hi> might have sacrific'd him to his passion, he honourably dismiss'd back to you: He had him in his power, and yet at the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant when the news of the bloody assassination of his Brother <hi>Gratian</hi> was brought him, conquered his just resentment, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerously scorn'd to repay like for like. Weigh the case, and be your self judge in this matter. He sent you back your Brother a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live and well, do you return him his though dead. Why should you deny him the remains of his Brother, who did not deny you assistances against himself? But you are afraid that at the sight of his body, the grief of his Souldiers should stir afresh; for so you pretend, that they will revenge his death, whom they deserted
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:49523:264"/> when alive. Why should you fear him being dead, whom you slew, when 'twas in your power to have preserved him? You'le say 'tis like, I did but kill mine Enemy: No, he was not your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, but you his; he is now incapable of making, or being gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by any defence that can be made for him. Consider but your own case. Suppose any one in these parts should at this time make Head against you, and usurp the Empire; I desire to know, whether you would account your self his Enemy, or him yours? If I mistake not, 'tis the Usurper makes the War, the Emperor does but defend his right. And can you deny his ashes, whom you ought not to have put to death? Let <hi>Valentinian</hi> have his Brothers remains, at least as pledges of the Peace. Can you pretend, you commanded him not to be kill'd, whom you forbid to be buried? Who can believe but you begrutch'd him his Life, whom you envy the ease and honour of a Grave? But to return. I understand you take it ill, that <hi>Valentinian</hi>'s Friends fled rather to the Emperor <hi>Theodosius,</hi> than to your self: And could you ever expect it to be otherwise, when you sent to demand those that fled, that you might bring them to condign punishment, and put to death as many as you got within your power, while <hi>Theodosius</hi> rewarded and preferr'd those that sled to him. <hi>MAX.</hi> Whom did I put to death? <hi>AMBR. Bailio,</hi> a gallant man, and a brave Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander; and was it cause enough to take away his Life, that he was faithful to his Prince? <hi>MAX.</hi> I did not command him to be put to death. <hi>AMBR.</hi> 'Twas so reported with us, that he was commanded to be slain. <hi>MAX.</hi> Indeed had he not laid hands upon himself, I had given order that he should be carried to <hi>Cabilonum,</hi> and there burnt alive. <hi>AMBR.</hi> It was not then without ground, that the report went abroad, that you had kill'd him. And who could hope to escape, when so great a Commander, so stout a Souldier, so useful an Officer was put to death?</q>

                     <p n="2">II. WITH this freedom and impartiality did the holy man treat the Tyrant, a man would have thought to the immediate peril of his head. But for that time they parted fair, <hi>Maximus</hi> promising to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with him into a treaty of Peace. But finding afterwards that he refus'd Communion with him, and all the Bishops of his Party (who were generally of the <hi>Ithacian</hi> Sect) he grew angry, and in a passion commanded him forthwith to depart the Court. He wanted not Friends that advis'd him to look about him, there would be snares and ambushes laid for him, and that the Usurper was too much gall'd with his freedom and plainness, not to seek revenge. Before he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, he interceded in the behalf of one <hi>Hyginus</hi> an aged Bishop, who was then ordered to be banish'd, that at least he might be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd with Provisions sit for a Person of his Age and Quality, and not be thrust out without a Garment to cover him, or a Bed to lye on; but was repuls'd in his Address, and himself thrust out of doors. So he return'd to <hi>Milan,</hi> gave the Emperor an account of his Embassy, and withall advised him to be cautious how he treated with <hi>Maximus,</hi> a concealed Enemy, who pretended Peace, but intended War.

In his Sermon he brought in our Lord thus speaking to the Emperor. <hi>I rais'd thee from a very mean condition to the Empire, I delivered thine Enemies Army into thine hands, with all his Furniture and Preparation, and brought his Person within thy Power; I have plac'd thy Son upon the Throne, and caused thee to triumph without any labor or difficulty, and dost thou now cause mine Enemies to triumph over me?</hi> He ended his Sermon, and as he was coming down the Stairs, Bishop <hi>(said the Emperor)</hi> have you preach'd this against me to day? No, Sir, <hi>replied the Bishop,</hi> I have not preach'd against, but for you. I confess <hi>(an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered the Emperor)</hi> I decreed hard things against the Bishop, when I commanded that he should repair the Synagogue. The Courtiers that were present told him, that the Monks however ought to be punished. Which <hi>Ambrose</hi> overhearing replied, my business at this time is with the Emperor, I shall deal with you at another rate. So he obtain'd that the Edict should be revers'd, nor would he go up to the Altar, till the Emperor had solemnly engag'd his Faith that it should be done, which he accordingly did, and then the Bishop went up, and administred the holy Sacrament, and the remaining Offices of Devotion.</p>

But their Petition was rejected.

S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> immediately stept in, and vehemently interceded with the Emperor, and so plyed the business, that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror promis'd to pardon the Riot that had been committed. But the Bishop being gone, the great Officers at Court deeply resenting the violence and indignity that had been offered to men in publick Authority, and considering what encouragement unpunisht Villany might hereafter give to popular fury, prest the Emperor to revenge, and obtain'd a Warrant for Execution, which was sent accordingly. And that the thing might be done more effectually, the People were invited to the <hi>Circus</hi> under pretence of publick sports, where the Souldiers without any warning broke in upon them, and making no difference slew all that came next to hand; thence they proceeded in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the City, which they fill'd with blood and cruelty. Nor did Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers fare any better than the rest, all Laws of Nature and Nations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at this time trodden under foot. A Merchant had his two Sons seiz'd, and hal'd towards Execution, the Father followed, and passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately begg'd their lives, praying that himself might dye in their stead, and offering the Souldiers his whole Estate into the Bargain. The most barbarous nature could not but relent a little at such a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, the Souldiers told him, their number must be made up, they could not dismiss both his Sons, one they were content to spare, and bid him make his choice. And now nature was divided, and began to contest with it self. The good man equally lov'd both, he sigh'd and wept, argued and disputed, but could come to no resolution with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himself, not knowing which to part with. And in this conflict of thoughts and passions he continued, till they were both slain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his eyes. In short, the slaughter continued three whole hours, and seven thousand were put to death, without any Trial or Enquiry to distinguish between the guilty and the innocent.</p>

<pb n="409" facs="tcp:49523:266"/> his Majesty coming into the Church, at whose approach he had been immediately forbidden from above to consecrate and dispence the holy Communion; that nothing but a hearty repentance could restore him, which, if he gave any credit to him, he would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately set upon, if not, he would not take it amiss, that he prefer'd his duty to God before the respect that he owed to the Emperor.</q>
                        <hi>Theodosius</hi> having read the Letter, began to be troubled, and to be uneasie in his own mind: He was a good man, and though naturally apt to receive quick impressions of anger, was as soon reduc'd to a just sence of things. He came back to <hi>Milan,</hi> and as he was wont, went to Church, but the Bishop met him at the Church-porch, and forbid him any further entrance. <hi>Perhaps Sir,</hi> (said he) <hi>you do not rightly apprehend the horribleness of the Massacre lately committed, for though the storm of your fury be blown over, yet reason has not yet recovered its sight, to discern clearly the greatness of the mischief. The Imperial lustre, 'tis like, blinds your eyes that you cannot see your Offence, and your power imposes upon your reason. But you should do well withal to keep an eye to the frail and corruptible condition of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, and to reflect upon that original dust, out of which we were all made, and unto which we must all return. Let not the splendor of your purple Robes hinder you from being acquainted with the infirmities of that body which they cover. You are, Sir, of the same make with those Subjects which you govern, who are not your Subjects only, but in some sence your fellow-servants. For there is one Lord and Emperor of the World, the great Creator of all things. And with what eyes then will you behold the Temple of this common Lord? With what feet will you tread his Sanctuary? How will you stretch forth those hands in prayer, that are still reeking with the blood of the innocent? How will you presume with such hands to receive the most sacred Body of our Lord? How will you lift up his precious Blood to those Lips, which lately uttered so savage a decree for the unjust shedding so much blood? Depart therefore, and seek not by a second Offence to aggravate your former fault, but quietly take the yoak upon you, which our great Lord has from above allotted for you. 'Tis sharp, but 'tis Medicinal, and immediately conducive to your health.</hi> The great Prince was amaz'd at so home and severe an entertainment; something he offered by way of extenuation, that even <hi>David</hi> had been guilty both of Murder and Adultery. The holy man replyed, <hi>Him whom you followed in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="6">VI. THE Emperor now sufficiently sensible of his case, return'd back to the Pallace, and testified his grief by all the expressions of tears and sorrow. Eight months he remained in this penitential state, all which time he wore nothing but mourning Garments. The Solemnity of <hi>Christmass</hi> was now near at hand, at the remembrance whereof the Emperor then sitting in the Palace burst out into tears. <hi>Rufin,</hi> Controuler of the Palace, a bold man, and familiar with the Emperor, observing it, askt him what was the cause of his grief, whereat he fell into a more violent passion. <q>
                           <hi>Rufin</hi> (said he) thou dost but make sport and mock me, thou little knowest the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles I feel: I weep and bewail my hard fate; servants and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars may freely go into the House of God, and pour out their prayers to Heaven, while the Church doors, and consequently the Gates of Heaven are shut up against me: For I remember what our
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:49523:267"/> Lord has peremptorily declared, <hi>Whatsoever you shall bind on Earth, shall be bound in Heaven.</hi> If that be it (replyed <hi>Rufinus</hi>) if you please, I'le run to the Bishop, and pray him to release the Sentence. No, said the Emperor, you will never be able to perswade <hi>Ambrose.</hi> I know the justness of the Sentence he has past, and that he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver out of Reverence to the Imperial Dignity betray the Commands of God.</q>
                        <hi>Rufin</hi> persisted in his confidence that he should prevail, and so the Emperor gave him leave to go, himself soon after follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, led with the assurance which the other had given him. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi> no sooner saw the Controuler coming towards him, but he abruptly broke out, <q>
                           <hi>Rufin</hi> (said he) you have put on a shameless impudence: You were the adviser of this Massacre, and now you have laid aside all shame, and neither blush nor tremble at so great an assault as you have made upon the Image of God.</q> The man fell to intreaties, and told him the Emperor would be there by and by; <q>if so (said the Bishop) <hi>Rufin,</hi> I tell you plainly, I shall forbid him to enter the Church-porch:</q> And if he think good to turn his power into force and Tyranny, here I am, most ready to undergo any death he shall allot me. 'Twas no time to stand dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting, <hi>Rufin</hi> knew the Bishops resolution, and therefore dispatcht a Message to the Emperor, to let him know what had past, and to perswade him to stay at home. The Message met him just as he was coming over the Market-place, which when he heard, he reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>I'le go however, and undergoe the shame I have justly deserved.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come near the Church he stopt, and addressing himself to the Bishop, who sat in a Room hard by, prayed he might be absolv'd. <hi>Ambrose</hi> bluntly told him, that his coming thither was a forcible and violent invasion, that he fought against God, and trod his Laws un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foot. To which the Emperor calmly answered, <q>I do not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front the establisht Constitutions, nor desire contrary to Law to enter within the holy doors, I only beg to be releas'd from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicatory Sentence, and that herein you would consider and imitate the compassion and tenderness of our common Lord, and not bar up those Gates against me, which our Lord has set open to all Penitents. What signs of Penitence (said <hi>Ambrose</hi>) have you given for so foul a Crime? With what Medicines have you cur'd your Wounds? 'Tis your part (replyed the Emperor) to prescribe the Remedy, to mix the Ingredients, to apply the Plaister; mine, to submit, and comply with the prescriptions. Since then (said the Bishop) you have let the Reins loose to rage and fierceness, and that 'twas not reason, but passion dictated the Warrant, let a Law be drawn up henceforth, to cancel all Decrees past in hast and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, let all Warrants that touch Life, or forfeiture of Estates be kept thirty dayes after signing, that there may be respite for a more mature and deliberate Judgment; which time expir'd, let them who drew up the Warrant, again present it to you; that so Reason being freed from the fumes and clouds of anger, may impartially weigh the case, and discern whether it be right or wrong; if it appear to be wrong, it is plain, it ought then to reverse it, if right, to confirm and ratifie it; and so by this delay, the affair will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with most advantage. <hi>Theodosius</hi> readily embrac'd the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which he approv'd as useful and excellent advice, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

And when the time of offering came, he went up with tears to the Communion-Table, and having made his Offering, stood still within the Rails, as the Custom was for the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors to do in the <hi>Eastern</hi> Church. <hi>Ambrose</hi> either not knowing it, or taking no notice of it, ask't him what he wanted; he answered, he waited to receive the holy Sacrament; the Bishop sent the chief Deacon to him to let him know, that the places within the Railes were reserved only for the Clergy, that therefore he should go and stand with the rest without, for though the purple made men Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, it did not make them Priests. A rebuke which the good Emperor took with an even and composed mind, commanding them to acquaint the Bishop, that he had not taken that place out of any pride or arrogance, but because it was the Custom to do so at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> however that he thank't him for his Correction. And it made such deep impression, that at his return to <hi>Constantinople</hi> he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways went and stood without the Railes; and when <hi>Nectarius</hi> the Bishop askt him why he did so, he answered with a sigh, that he had at length been taught the difference between a Prince and a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, and had with much difficulty found a teacher of truth, and that <hi>Ambrose</hi> was the only Person he had met with that truly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd the name of a Bishop. Thus ended the contest between <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odosius</hi> and S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> wherein how far <hi>Ambrose</hi> overstrained the string, I shall not now dispute, remembring I here sustain the Person not of a Divine, but an Historian.</p>
                     <p n="7">VII. WE mention'd a Synod that assisted S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of <hi>Theodosius:</hi> It was at that time assembled at <hi>Milan</hi> upon this occasion. <hi>Jovinian,</hi> a secret Disciple of <hi>Helvidius</hi> had liv'd some years in S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> his Monastery at <hi>Milan,</hi> covering ill designs under a vail of Piety. At last he threw off his Monastick habit, putting on the most gaudy and splendid Attire, and indulging himself in all the modes and fashions, the pleasures and delicacies of a Secular Life. And because all was nothing unless he set up for the Head of a Sect, he vented such Doctrines as these; that Marriage was a state <hi>Caeteris paribus,</hi> of equal merit and perfection with Coelebacy; that they who had been duly regenerate by Baptism, could not be undermin'd and subverted by the Devil; that the abstaining from some sorts of meats was no whit better than an indifferent usage of them, provided they were used with thanksgiving; and that all who were careful to live according to their baptismal Obligation, should have an equal reward in Heaven. And methinks had he taught no worse than this, he had not deserv'd so loud and severe an out-cry to be made against him. But it seems (as 'tis the fate of Seducers to wax worse and worse) he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards maintain'd, that the Mother of our Lord after the birth of Christ ceas'd to be a Virgin, and had other Children, and what is yet worse than that, that Christ did not take true flesh upon him. Being
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:49523:268"/> forc'd to quit <hi>Milan,</hi> he fled to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he succesfully propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated his Opinions, and wrote several Books in vindication of them. Pope <hi>Siricius</hi> presently conven'd the Presbytery of that City, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned him and his followers, an account whereof he sent by three Presbyters in a Letter<note n="l" place="margin">Ext.

                        </note> directed to the Church of <hi>Milan,</hi> where up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the arrival of some Prelates out of <hi>France,</hi> a Synod of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Bishops was met about this matter. They read <hi>Siricius</hi>'s E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle, and then proceeded to a Synodical Censure, condemning the men and their <hi>dogmata,</hi> and then writ an answer<note n="m" place="margin">Ext. ibid. col. <hi>1024.</hi>
                        </note> to <hi>Siricius,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they commend his care and sollicitude in his Pastoral station, his diligent watching over the Flock against the attempts of Wolves, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which they descend to a particular confutation of <hi>Jovinian</hi>'s Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.

In his private Life, he was infinitely kind to all his Kindred and Relations; neat, but not costly in his Entertainments, pleasant in his Discourses according to Persons and Things, but never transgressing the Laws of gravity; moderate in his Recreations, and temperate in his Diet.

                        </note>, unless where sickness interpos'd and took him off) are either <hi>Tracts</hi> (Books purposely writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten on some particular Subjects) or <hi>Sermons,</hi> or <hi>Epistles,</hi> or <hi>Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries.</hi>
                        <pb n="420" facs="tcp:49523:272"/> Among his <hi>Tracts</hi> there are some, which are charg'd to be little better than Translations out of Greek. Thus S. <hi>Jerom</hi> long since observ'd of his Books <hi>de spiritu sancto,</hi> that he borrow'd most of them out of a Book of <hi>Didymus</hi> upon that argument, and in his transferring of them made them worse; that he frequently transcribes the <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers, and especially <hi>Origen.</hi> It must be granted, that he makes no little use of the <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers Writings; nor is it any wonder, that he who came late to the Study of Theology, should make some more than ordinary use of the helps that had been before him, and that he who was peculiarly skill'd in the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue, should convey the Treasures of the <hi>East</hi> into the <hi>Western</hi> World, without always mentioning the particular port, from whence he brought them. No man (as <hi>Erasmus</hi> well observes in this case) blames <hi>Cicero</hi> for being so conversant in the Books of <hi>Plato,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving thence a good part of his Philosophy into his own Writings; 'tis <hi>Plato</hi>'s notions in <hi>Tully</hi>'s dress. And yet this is no dishonest Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giarism, but a warrantable imitation. It must likewise be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred that <hi>Jerom</hi> seems to have had a particular pique at S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> of whom he seldom speaks very favourably. <hi>Jerom</hi> was a man of passions, one that had no mean Opinion of himself, and who seldom gives an over-advantageous Character, where he thinks himself over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>top'd. Though elsewhere he makes honourable mention of him, saying, that when he was made Bishop of <hi>Milan,</hi> all <hi>Italy</hi> was soon reduc'd back to the Catholick Faith. His <hi>Sermons,</hi> Homilies, or Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are generally short, and delivered in a popular way, no great number whereof, considering the frequency of his preaching, have been transmitted to us. Of his <hi>Epistles</hi> there are still extant eight Books, monuments of great prudence and piety, containing either Historical Occurrences of those times, or Explications of some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Texts of Scripture, that by Letter had been propounded to him. Lastly, his <hi>Commentaries</hi> upon the Scripture run much upon the Allegorical strain, and in these it is, that he is chiefly oblig'd to <hi>Origen.</hi> His <hi>Commentaries</hi> upon <hi>Luke</hi> were the early Fruit of his Episcopal Studies: He wrote also upon S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epistles, but those extant at this day, are falsly entitled to his name.</p>
                     <p n="7">VII. WE have seen the man, and the Monuments he left behind him. And what wonder now if a man thus accomplish'd, a Person so venerable for his learning and piety were renowned through the World. Indeed the common Suffrage of all antiquity has assign'd him the first place among the <hi>four</hi> great Doctors of the <hi>Latine</hi> Church. Nay even in his Life time he was not only honour'd by the more civil and polite part of the World, but his name was reverenc'd even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong barbarous Nations: Whereof an instance or two shall suffice. When <hi>Count Arbogastes</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">Paulin. ubi supr. p. <hi>6,</hi>
                        </note> had subdued the <hi>Franks</hi> (his own Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men) and upon the conclusion of a Peace was entertain'd by the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of that Country, he was ask'd among other things, whether he was acquainted with <hi>Ambrose.</hi> He told them he was, that he had a particular interest in the man, and had been frequently treated at his Table. No wonder then (replyed the Princes) you carry all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, when you are favour'd and befriended by a man, who says to the Sun, <hi>stand,</hi> and it stands still. Nor had the <hi>Western</hi> World only this good Opinion of him, his Fame spread into the remoter Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:49523:272"/> of the <hi>East.</hi> Besides his Correspondence with S. <hi>Basil,</hi> two of the wisest and most honourable men in <hi>Persia</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="margin">Id. ib. p. <hi>5.</hi>
                        </note> having heard the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of him, undertook a journey on purpose to <hi>Milan,</hi> as the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> once did to <hi>Solomon,</hi> to see him, and put hard questions to him. They came, and by an Interpreter disputed with him from morning till night, till they admir'd and were fully satisfied in his incomparable Wisdom. And that it might appear that they came this chargeable, difficult, and tedious Journey upon no other errand; the very next morning they took their leave of the Emperor, and just passing by <hi>Rome,</hi> only to salute the illustrious <hi>Anicius Probus</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of <hi>Italy,</hi> they return'd directly into their own Country.</p>

But the main business of the Letter was to beg of him to give them an account of the Opinions and Practises of the several Heresies that had disturb'd the Church; a task which could not but be infinitely acceptable to them and all good men. Hereupon he compos'd his larger Work <hi>against Heresies,</hi> wherein besides the Historical part, he makes a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Confutation of every Heresie, amounting in all to the number of LXXX. which he draws down through the several ages of the World to his own time, that is, till the eleventh<note n="x" place="margin">Vid. adv.

John</hi> was a man proud and passionate, and besides of wavering and inconstant Principles: He had herded<note n="c" place="margin">Vid. Hieron. ad Pammach. p. <hi>163, 165.</hi>
                     </note> with the <hi>Arian</hi> and <hi>Macedonian</hi> Party during the late Persecutions in the Reign of <hi>Valens,</hi> and though he had deserted them upon his promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to that See, yet he still retain'd some kindness for the old Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, especially was a secret friend to the Doctrines of <hi>Origen,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Epiphanius</hi> was a profess'd Antagonist. This begat mutual jealousies, which at last burst out into an open flame. It hapned that <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> preaching<note n="d" place="margin">Id. ib p. <hi>166.</hi>
                     </note> in the Cathedral at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> directed his Discourse against the <hi>Origenian dogmata.</hi> The Bishop thought himself touch'd with the Sermon, and together with his Clergy sometimes by signs of anger, sometimes by expressions of scorn and derision shew'd that he sat uneasie, and pitied the doting old man, till not able to hold longer, he sent up his Arch-deacon to him, commanding him to cease preaching about those matters. And when after Sermon, as they were going from the place of the <hi>Resurrection</hi> to that of the <hi>Cross,</hi>
                     <pb n="431" facs="tcp:49523:277"/> People of all sorts flock'd after <hi>Epiphanius</hi> in such Crowds, and with such expressions of reverence and devotion, that there was no passing forwards, the others envy began to boyl, and he could not forbear telling him to his Face, that he purposely contriv'd and caus'd these stops. And when at another time the Congregation was born in hand that they should again hear <hi>Epiphanius, John</hi> himself stept into the Pulpit, and thundred out nothing but sharp invectives against the Heresie of the <hi>Anthropomorphites,</hi> who affirm, that God has humane parts and shape, turning himself all the while towards <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> to insinuate a suspition into the Peoples minds, that he was guilty of that impious and absurd Opinion. Sermon being ended, the good old Bishop stood up, and told the Congregation, that what his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had spoken against the <hi>Anthropomorphite</hi>-Heresie was very well, and that he himself heartily condemn'd it; but that withal it was but just, that as they condemn'd this Heresie, they should condemn likewise the perverse Doctrines of <hi>Origen.</hi> A motion which the Congregation entertain'd with laughter and acclamations to the equal shame and vexation of their Bishop.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. HITHERTO they had stood on some tolerable Terms, when <hi>John</hi> laid hold on an opportunity of openly venting his spleen, and that upon this occasion. <hi>Epiphanius</hi>'s Monastery<note n="e" place="margin">Epiph. Epist. ad Joan. ap. Hieron. p. <hi>156, 157.</hi>
                     </note> was destitute of a Priest, who might constantly officiate the Divine Services amongst them, a task which S. <hi>Jerom</hi> and <hi>Vincentius,</hi> both Presbyters, who liv'd near at hand in the Monastery at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> out of modesty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd to undertake. Complaint hereof being made to <hi>Epiphanius</hi> by the Brethren of the Monastery, a fit man was sought for, and <hi>Pauli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianus</hi> S. <hi>Jerom</hi>'s younger Brother was the Person pitcht on for this purpose: But he out of humility did not only decline it, but refus'd to come near any Bishop lest he should lay hands upon him. At length going along with others to wait upon <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> then in those parts, about some business of the Monastery, the Bishop commanded the Deacons that were present to apprehend him, and so overpowred him with the weight of his Authority and Perswasion, that he unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly submitted to be ordain'd Deacon; which <hi>Epiphanius</hi> presently perform'd in the Parish-church next to the Monastery, as after some convenient time, though with the same difficulty, he advanc'd him to the order of Presbyter, dessgning him as Domestick Chaplain to that Monastery. The Report hereof was soon carried to <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> who was not a little glad of the opportunity. He now fill'd every corner with loud Declamations against <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> that he had violated the Canons of the Church, by taking upon him to Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain out of his own Diocess, that the Person ordain'd<note n="f" place="margin">Hier. ad Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach. in sin.

                     </note> was little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than a Boy, and if any of his Clergy own'd his Ordination, they should lose their place in the Church; that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> had traduc'd him for an Heretick<note n="g" place="margin">Epiph. Epist. p. <hi>157.</hi>
                     </note>, and in his publick Devotions had pray'd for him in these words, <hi>Grant, Lord, to</hi> John, <hi>that he may believe aright;</hi> that therefore he was resolv'd to make him know himself, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint all parts of the Christian World with his unwarrantable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canonical Proceedings, and that if men would not do him right, he summon'd him to a Tryal before the Divine Tribunal. To all this bluster <hi>Epiphanius</hi> return'd him a gentle Letter, wherein he mildly reproves him for his passionate and unchristian carriage in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:49523:278"/> and lays before him the true state of what had pass'd; assuring him, he might rather have expected thanks for what he had done, than that it should be made the Foundation of a Quarrel; that he had done nothing herein, but what in like cases had been customary in his Countrey, where Catholick Bishops ordain'd Presbyters with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his Province, yea, that he had desired some (particularly <hi>Philo</hi> and <hi>Theoprobus</hi>) that because his Diocess was wide and large, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in those Churches of it that lay next to theirs, they would Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain Presbyters, as occasion requir'd, and provide for the necessities of the Church; that he of all others had least reason to complain, the Ordination being done not in his, but in the Diocess of <hi>Eleuthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropolis,</hi> and that if any found themselves agrieved, it must be, as S. <hi>Jerom</hi> observes, the Bishop of <hi>Caesarea,</hi> who was Metropolitan of the whole Province. For the age of the Person ordained, S. <hi>Jerom</hi> adds, that he was not much under thirty, and that <hi>John</hi> himself was not much above, when he was made Bishop, and had ordained others at that very age, whereat <hi>Paulinianus</hi> was made Presbyter. But the truth was, as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> tells<note n="h" place="margin">Loc. supr. c. tat.</note> him, it was not so much the business of <hi>Paulinianus</hi> that had mov'd his Choler, the root of the matter lay deeper, 'twas that he had rubb'd him sometimes with his Affection to <hi>Origen</hi> and his Opinions; whom he had charged as the Parent of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anism,</hi> and other dangerous errors; 'twas the touching this tender string had offended his ears, and put him into such an angry ferment: for the Charge of traducing him in his Devotions, 'twas a great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake, he might be confident he was not guilty of so much rudeness, but bore a greater Reverence towards him and his Office, than so to vilisie him before the People, that he had done but what was usual in the conclusion of the publick Prayers, to pray for him as he did for all other Bishops, that God would keep him, and grant him to Preach the word of Truth: That therefore he passionately besought him especially to renounce all Communion with <hi>Origens,</hi> or any other Heretical Opinions, to which end he lays before him eight several Principles asserted by <hi>Origen,</hi> which he desires him as a <hi>Sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="8">VIII. BUT <hi>John</hi> has not yet done with his Charge, he further accuses<note n="i" place="margin">Epiph. Epist. ib. in sin.</note> him of injury and violence, and that he had in a manner robb'd one of the Churches in his Diocess. The truth of which case was thus. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> in his way to <hi>Bethel</hi> came to a Village called <hi>Anablatha,</hi> where espying a Church, he turned in to offer up his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Entring into the Church, he beheld a Curtain hanging over the door, whereon was painted the Image of Christ, or some Saint. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing such Innovations in the Church, expresly contrary to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the holy Scriptures (as himself tells us) he tore the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and advised the Churchwardens to make use of it rather as a Shroud to bury the dead. They told him that since he had torn that, 'twas but reasonable he should give them another, that was not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious. This he immediately promis'd, and after some time sent the best he could get, desiring the Bishop to convey it to the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters of that place, and that he would henceforward take care, that such painted Curtains being against our Religion, should not be hung up in the Church of Christ, it being much more his duty to be
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:49523:278"/> watchful and sollicitous, to remove an occasion of scruple that was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of the Church of Christ, and the People committed to his Charge. A passage so clearly expressive of the Doctrine and Practice of the Church in the point of Images n that age, that the Champions of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are at infinite loss about it. Some of them say, that the good Bishop treated the Picture with that resentment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he supposed it to have been the Image of some infamous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, usurping the place of a Saint; others that this Epistle is spuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and falsly Fathered upon <hi>Epiphanius;</hi> others that this latter part of it only is Supposititious, added by a later hand; and this way goe <hi>Baronius, Bellarmin,</hi> and the most, without any Authority, or just pretence of reason. And therefore <hi>Baronius</hi> after all the pains he had taken to make it seem an imposture, dares not yet be very confident of his own Conjecture.

The Spirit of the man was too far exulcerated, to be heal'd with any Lenitives, or calm Replyes which <hi>Epiphanius</hi> could return: His Choler still boil'd against him, and the Monks of <hi>Palestine</hi> that sided with him, especially S. <hi>Jerom,</hi> who took part with <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> and so gall'd the other with his tart Reflections, that he suspended<note n="l" place="margin">Hier. ad Pam. p. <hi>179.</hi>

The <hi>Count</hi> sent him word, that they would stay a day or two longer, if he would then come. But all in vain, the Woman was still sick, and the same Excuse must serve the turn. By this 'twas evident to all impartial Observers, that he distrusted his Cause, and durst not abide a Tryal, so that refusing to give <hi>Epiphanius</hi>
                     <pb n="434" facs="tcp:49523:279"/> any answer, either by word or Letter, the good old Bishop wrote to the Monks, not to Communicate with him, till he had given sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in those points of Heresie, whereof he stood impeacht. But so far was he from that, that he set himself to make a wider breach, and what he had formerly threatned, that the World should ring of <hi>Epiphanius</hi>'s actings, he now put in Execution, writing Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into all parts, and among the rest, probably, to <hi>Theophilus</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> who either at his invitation, or of his own accord, sent <hi>Isidore</hi>

And when he did come, he took no care to pursue the ends of his Legation: Thrice indeed he gave meeting to the other Party, and entertain'd them with the Commands of his Master, and a parcel of smooth words tending to Peace, but conceal'd the Letters which <hi>Theophilus</hi> had sent to them. And when S. <hi>Jerom</hi> once and again demanded them, he refused to deliver them, confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing he had been engag'd to do so by the Bishop of <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> And so his Legation came to nothing.

                     <hi>Epiphanius</hi> had waited for satisfaction, and had patiently born the injuries which <hi>John</hi> had thrown upon him, hoping that at last he would clear his Reputation, and do right to Truth. But he found the man incurable, and that the only use he made of his silence, was to fill the World with clamours against him. He resolv'd therefore to be no longer wanting to himself, but dispatcht away Letters<note n="s" place="margin">Ib. p. <hi>189.</hi> in sin.</note> to all the most considerable Churches, to the Bishops of <hi>Palestine,</hi> to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and especially to Pope <hi>Siricius</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> where <hi>John</hi>'s Complaints had made the loudest noise. But because the Controversie was not clearly understood there, <hi>Pammachius</hi> a learned Gentleman of <hi>Rome,</hi> who upon the death of his Wife <hi>Paulina</hi> had taken the Monastick Rule upon him, wrote to S. <hi>Jerom,</hi> desiring from
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:49523:279"/> him a full account of this matter; which he accordingly gave him in a very large learned and eloquent Epistle, wherein he truly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents matter of Fact, vindicates <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and himself, and describes <hi>John</hi> in his proper colours. This Letter was written <hi>Ann.</hi> CCCXCIII. shortly after which he sent another much to the same effect to <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ophilus</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> to undeceive him in those things, wherein <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Isidore</hi> might have misinform'd him; the aspersions which had been thrown upon himself, he wipes off with an elegant defence, and assures him, that notwithstanding all the spiteful attempts which <hi>John</hi> had made against him and his Party, yet they were heartily disposed to Peace, if he would but give the World satisfaction in the business of his Faith. The <hi>Epiphanius</hi> Cause being thus brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to open light, <hi>John</hi> saw 'twas in vain to bear up against the Stream, and so fairly let it fall, never after, that I find, appearing in it. By which means the good old man gain'd a present respite. But it last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not long. For the <hi>Origenian</hi> Controversie being soon after reviv'd, though upon another occasion, involv'd him in fresh troubles, that ended not but with his Life.

Upon this the Monasteries were divided, many defending the Orthodox Notion, while others of the simpler sort understanding those places of Scripture (which ascribe Eyes, Face, Hands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to God) in a strict literal sence, fiercely espous'd the latter part of the Question, and because <hi>Origen</hi>'s Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings were chiefly made use of to beat down their Opinion, they wholly rejected them, and quarrell'd with all that did approve and own them. <hi>Theophilus</hi> was at this time Bishop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> a man subtle and politick, and one that knew how at any time to put a good Colour upon a bad Cause, and to sail with every Wind, by which he might reach the point he aim'd at. He had in his <hi>Paschal</hi> Letters sufficiently declared himself for the incorporeal Opinion, and in his Sermons smartly inveighed against those of the opposite Party. This quickly came to the Monks at <hi>Nitria,</hi> who alarm'd with it, flock'd in a great Body to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> intending to make him redeem his impiety (as they call'd it) with the price of his Head. He was aware of their coming, and going forth to meet them, entertain'd them with a pleasant look, addressing to them in the words of <hi>Jacob</hi> to his Brother <hi>Esau, I have seen you, as though I had seen the Face of God.</hi> With this crafty and ambiguous answer the deep pated Monks were well pleas'd and satisfied, supposing he meant, that God had a Face like to theirs; but added withal, if you mean really what you say, condemn the Books of <hi>Origen,</hi> by which many are seduc'd into the contrary Opinion, and enabled to fight against us; and unless you do this, we are resolv'd to treat you as an impious Person, and an Enemy to God. The Bishop replyed, be not angry, Sirs, I am ready
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:49523:280"/> to do what you have a mind to, I for my part detest the Books of <hi>Origen,</hi> and condemn all those that admit them. And with that assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance they departed, confident that they had got the day.</p>
                  <p n="12">XII. And here the Controversie might have slept and dyed, had not <hi>Theophilus</hi> thought good to awaken it, to minister to his private malice and revenge. Four Brothers there were, from the talness of their Stature call'd <hi>Longi,</hi> who presided over the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, <hi>Dioscurus, Ammonius, Eusebius</hi> and <hi>Euthymius,</hi> all of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown'd for their learning and pious Lives, in great favour with <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ophilus,</hi> who receiv'd them with all imaginable kindness and respect. <hi>Dioscurus,</hi> though unwilling, he consecrated Bishop of <hi>Hermopolis,</hi> and two others of them he in a manner forc'd to live with him at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria,</hi> and made them Stewards of the Revenues of his Church. But they weary of the cares of a Secular Life, as too great an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment upon their Pious and Philosophick <hi>genius,</hi> and much more weary of <hi>Theophilus</hi>'s griping and covetous practises, who put them upon ill courses to advance his Projects, resolved to return back to their beloved Solitudes. The Bishop did what he could to disswade them from it, but when he perceived their Resolution unalterable, and much more the Reason that made them desert him, he began to storm, and threaten he would be even with them, which they little regarding went back to the Monasteries. At the same time he fell out with <hi>Isidore,</hi>

However putting the best face he could upon it, he excommunicated and ejected <hi>Isidore,</hi> who not knowing how far it might be safe for him to stay longer there, fled to Mount <hi>Nitria,</hi> where he had been brought up in his younger years, whom <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ophilus</hi> followed with Letters to the Bishops of those parts, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding them to cast him and his Partizans out of those solitary Recesses: The Monks hearing what was done, and pitying the hard case of <hi>Isidore,</hi> resolv'd that a Committee of their number, and <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monius</hi> in the Head of them should go to <hi>Alexandria</hi> to treat with the Bishop about this matter. <hi>Theophilus</hi> at first promised to restore <hi>Isidore</hi> to Communion, and being oft urg'd with his Promise, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage any more such Addresses threw one of the Monks into Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: Nay, we are told, that he threw the Tippet that he had about him over <hi>Ammonius</hi>'s neck with his own hands, and beating him about the Face, till he was all bloody, with a stern angry Voice, <hi>Heretick,</hi> said he, <hi>Anathematize Origen,</hi> though not the least occasion for any such Discourse was offered at that time. But <hi>Ammonius</hi> and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany voluntarily went to their Fellow in Prison, and refused to come
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:49523:280"/> out thence, till <hi>Theophilus</hi> himself came and should fetch them out. Afterwards they yielded to go to him, who having askt their pardon for what had been done, quietly dismist and sent them home.</p>
                  <p n="13">XIII. BUT how smooth soever he might appear without, his Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion boil'd up within. He had not forgot his former quarrel to <hi>Dios<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus</hi> and his Brethren, and though in his late rude treatment of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monius</hi> he had given him a tast of his kindness, yet he resolv'd now to pay them home all together; which yet he could not effect, but by creating a difference between them and the other Monks; who held them in a mighty esteem and veneration. And no way could he think of so proper for this, as again to set on foot among them the late buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed controversie. He knew <hi>Ammonius</hi> and his Brethren were stiff As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The design quickly took, and the far greater part of the Monks being simple and illiterate, were for the gross and absur'd part of the question: But what they wanted in learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they made up in Zeal, bandying the case not with accurate Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putings, but with noise and clamour. The Dissentions ran high, and grew irreconcilable, and names of reproach were sixt upon each Party, the Assertors of Corporcity scornfully styling the others <hi>Origen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ists,</hi> as they on the contrary branded them with the Title of <hi>Anthropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphites.</hi> And that he might yet cast a further mist before mens eyes, he conven'd a Synod<note n="y" place="margin">Posthum. ap. Sulp. Sev. dialog. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>3.</hi> p. <hi>247.</hi>
                     </note> at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> where in frequent Sessions the Cause of <hi>Origen</hi> was ventilated, and many dangerous propositions gathered out of his Writings were produc'd, which his friends not daring to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, cryed out, that the places had been corrupted, and the things fraudulently inserted by Hereticks, a thing not to be wondred at, when they had not scrupled to offer violence to the Gospel it self; that therefore the body of his Works was not to be thrown away because of some adulterated passages, which a wise Reader would easily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish, and might reject what was corrupt, but retain what was Catholick truth. But this plea was over-rul'd, it being reply'd, that there were Books enough, which the Church receiv'd, that the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing those Books was not to be allow'd, which would do more mischief to the simple and unwary, than they could do good to the Wise and Learned, and therefore good and bad were to be rejected, and the Tares and Wheat to be thrown out together. The issue was, that no man should read, or keep by him the Books of <hi>Origen.</hi> And though this was nothing to the case of <hi>Dioscurus</hi> and his Brethren, whom <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ophilus</hi> knew to be far enough from patronizing any of <hi>Origen</hi>'s obnox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious opinions, they only using his authority to refell a pernicious and senceless Impiety, yet it serv'd his turn to raise a dust, and to clap a bad name upon them, and then expose them to the censure and hatred of the People, who perhaps would never enquire how they came to have that name put upon them.</p>

                     </note>, <hi>Theophilus</hi> wisely foreseeing, that had they been call'd, his actions must have been rifled into, and his fraud and ill arts would have been brought to light. And therefore he never proceeded against the body of the Monks, but only against <hi>Ammonius</hi> and his Brothers, against whom he procur'd a Synodal Sentence. Nay, if we may credit what <hi>Palla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> further relates, he procur'd five persons, men of no authority or account amongst the Monks, and therefore more likely to be pliable to his designs, one of whom he consecrated Bishop (though but of a little Village, there being no City to set him over) a second Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter, the three others Deacons. To these Confidents of his he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered Libels of accusation against the Brethren, which himself had fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and which they subscrib'd, and afterwards delivered to him in the face of the Church.

The truth is, the three Brothers upon the first news of his approach had hid themselves in a Well, the mouth whereof being covered over with a mat prov'd a safe shelter to them. The danger being over, and they well knowing those parts would afford them no protection, left the Country, and with <hi>Dioscurus</hi> (who had made his escape) fled into <hi>Palestine,</hi> first to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and then to <hi>Scythopolis</hi> (anciently call'd <hi>Bethsan,</hi> situate in the half Tribe of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasses</hi> on this side <hi>Jordan</hi>) where, as being best furnish'd with Palm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees, the leaves whereof the Monks made great use of in their ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mechanical operations, they seated themselves. Hither repair'd to them great numbers of their old company, about LXXX. say some; CXXVI. nay CCC. say others. But <hi>Theophilus</hi> his malice stopt not here, he wrote to the Bishops in <hi>Palestine</hi> in a strain lordly enough, that they ought not without his advice to have received these Fugitives, but in that their ignorance might excuse them, and he would pass it by, but that for the time to come they should not in any way of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse either Civil or Sacred, entertain them. However here they continued, till hearing that <hi>Theophilus</hi> design'd Messengers to <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> to complain against them at Court, they conceiv'd it best to be beforehand; so <hi>Dioscurus</hi> and several others repaired thither, where <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> then Arch-bishop of the Imperial See, receiv'd them with
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:49523:281"/> all due kindness and respect. By the whole carriage of this affair and what follows in relation to <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> it evidently appears that <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus</hi> indulg'd passion and prejudice beyond what became a good man. I know an attempt has lately been made to vindicate and relieve his memory, and to that end the whole story of his Transactions with these <hi>Egyptian</hi> Monks, has been call'd in question, and represented as a piece of Forgery, contriv'd by the <hi>Origenian</hi> Monks to impose upon the World. But this is a liberty which I confess I dare not take. The story is not only related by <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Sozomen,</hi> men of credit enough in other matters, and who had no particular interest to serve in this, who liv'd, if not in, very near that time, and were acquainted with some of the persons concerned in it, but it is very minutely related by <hi>Palladius,</hi> (or who-ever was the Author of that <hi>Dialogue</hi>) who with <hi>Chrysostom</hi> was concern'd in some part of the story, and was very familiarly acquainted both with the Persons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and the whole management of the business. I do not deny but those that favoured the <hi>Origenian</hi> way might set out <hi>Theophilus</hi> in his worst light, and might put a keener edge upon some of his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, than perhaps they deserv'd. But to say that the whole Story is feign'd, because <hi>Sozomen</hi> says his Friend, whom he could trust, had one particular passage in it from the Monks themselves (for what <hi>Sozomen</hi> says<note n="c" place="margin">Vid.

For suppose he had had the whole Relation from them: Is no man to be believ'd in his own Cause? Or can any man be so fit to tell the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Circumstances of his Case, as he that suffers them? And indeed if the credit of a Story so particularly related, so well attested, must be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy'd meerly for a few surmises, which a witty man may start in any matters of Fact, I scarce know what parts of Church-story can be secure.</p>

This done, he set forwards for the City. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> hearing of his approach, went out attended with the whole body of his Clergy to receive him with all due honour and respect, and kindly invited him to take up his residence with him in the Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Pallace. But he plainly shewed he came with a pre-conceived prejudice, for refusing the civility of the Invitation, he took up his Lodgings in a private House, where gathering together what Bishops were then in Town, he shewed them what Decrees had been made against <hi>Origen</hi>'s works, both in <hi>Cyprus</hi> and at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exhibiting any material Charge against them. Some of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops out of reverence to the man complyed with his perswasions, and
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:49523:282"/> subscrib'd the Decrees, but the greatest number refus'd, and among them <hi>Theotimus</hi> the <hi>Scythian</hi> Bishop according to the plain manner of his Countrey bluntly told him, <hi>for my part,</hi> Epiphanius, <hi>I shall not take upon me to dishonour a Person dead so long since, and who dyed with so fair a Reputation for learning and piety, nor shall I presume to condemn what our Ancestors never rejected, especially since I know of no ill Doctrine in</hi> Origen<hi>'s works.</hi> And with that he pluck'd out one of <hi>Origen</hi>'s Books, which he read before the Company, and shewed to contain Expositions agreeable to the sence of the Church. Adding, that this was an absurd and dangerous Course, and that they that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd these Expositions, were not aware that they condemn'd the Subjects upon which those Books were written.</p>
                  <p n="17">XVII. BY all that had been done <hi>Chrysostom</hi> was not yet discourag'd from treating <hi>Epiphanius</hi> with that respect that was due to his age and place.

To which he return'd this answer, That he would neither eat nor pray with him, till he had banish'd <hi>Dioscurus</hi> and his Party out of the City, and had subscribed the Decree against <hi>Origen</hi>'s Writings; whereto the other replyed, that it were a piece of unreasonable rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and folly to do any thing in this matter, before it had come under a publick Debate and Examination. S. <hi>Chrysostom</hi>'s Enemies were not to be told what use to make of this Difference, for finding <hi>Epiphanius</hi> forward enough, they push'd him on to all rash and unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised attempts, and this among the rest. There was to be the next day a great Assembly in the Church dedicated to the <hi>Apostles;</hi> hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they agreed <hi>Epiphanius</hi> should go, and standing up, should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the whole Congregation first condemn <hi>Origen</hi>'s Writings, next Excommunicate <hi>Dioscurus</hi> and his Company, and lastly reflect upon <hi>Chrysostom</hi> as siding with them: By which means they did not doubt but they should expose him to the Censure, if not hatred of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. This Design was discovered to <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> who the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing just as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> was going into the Church, sent him this Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage by <hi>Serapion</hi> his Deacon, that he had strangely violated the Canons of the Church, first in that he had taken upon him to Ordain in his Diocess, then that by his own Authority without any leave from him he had celebrated the Divine Service in his Churches, lastly that being once and again invited, he had refus'd to come at him, and still indulg'd himself in this Liberty; that he had best therefore take heed, lest raising a Tumult and Sedition among the People, the danger should finally return upon his own head. The timorous old man was startled at the Message, and immediately retir'd, and not long after left the City.</p>

He answered, no; upon what account then, replyed <hi>Ammonius,</hi> have you judg'd them to be Hereticks, whose Opinion you are a Stranger to, and whom you have never Convicted. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> answered, he had heard so of them.

Being sat down in his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, he held, as his Custom was, the New Testament in his hand, and with sighs and tears opened the Book, and then folded it up, and wept again; then he arose and prayed, and after sat down, and turning to his two Attendants, <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Polybius,</hi> began with tears to Discourse to them to this effect. <q>That if they lov'd him, they should keep his Commandments, and then the love of God should abide in them; they knew through how many Afflictions he had pass'd in his time, which yet he did not think burdensome,
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:49523:283"/> but was always chearful in any thing wherein God was concern'd, who had never sorsaken him, but delivered him out of all dangers, as all things work together for good to them that love God: That the Devil had oft assaulted and set upon him, especially by his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents in all places, the <hi>Simonians</hi> in <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> the <hi>Gnosticks</hi> in <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> the <hi>Valentinians</hi> and other Hereticks in <hi>Cyprus;</hi> that they should do well to hearken to his last Councils: Be not covetous, and you shall have enough; hate no man, and God will love you, speak not against a Brother, and the affection of the Devil shall not rule in you; detest all Heresies, as wild Beasts full of deadly Poyson, whereof I have given you an account in my <hi>Panarion;</hi> turn away from worldly pleasure, that's always ready to charm both Body and Soul, you'l find 'tis the way by which <hi>Satan</hi> makes his approach, nay, and that many times when no external temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is present, yet the minds of the unwary entertain themselves with impure Contemplations; but when the mind is kept chast and sober, and has God always within view and prospect, we shall be easily able to rout the Enemy.</q> Having discours'd to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, he commanded the whole Ships company to be call'd, and told them, it highly concern'd them all earnestly to sollicite the Divine mercy, that God would preserve and save them, for that there would be a mighty Storm, but withal, bad them be of good chear, for that none of them should be cast away. After having given some private directions to <hi>Polybius</hi> and <hi>Isaac,</hi> he sent for the Seamen, and bad them not be troubled at the Storm, but fly to God, and he would help them. At night the Storm began to arise, which continued two dayes and nights, the next day he prayed, embraced his two Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, saying, God preserve you, my Sons, for <hi>Epiphanius</hi> shall see you no more in this World, and with that expir'd, and immediately the Tempest ceast. Being arriv'd at <hi>Salamis,</hi> the news of his death fill'd the whole City and Countrey with an universal Lamentation, and flocking to the Shore, they took his Body out of the Ship, and honourably accompanied it to the Church, where it was embalm'd, put up, and at length interr'd. He dyed about the latter end of <hi>Ann.</hi> CCCCII. or rather the beginning of the following year, being of a great age. <hi>Polybius</hi> says<note n="l" place="margin">Ib.

The greatest part of his time was spent under the exact Laws and Discipline of the Monastick State, a quite different course of life from what <hi>Monachism</hi> is in these latter Ages.

He had long since expended his own Estate upon charitable uses, and he now as freely disperst the Revenues of his Church, which indeed had a considerable stock. For Persons from all parts sent in vast summs of Money to him as to a common Treasurer, and at their death bequeathed great Legacies and Endowments, being confident that he would dispose of them according to their pious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions and designs. And so he did with a very liberal hand, till his stock failing, Heaven became his immediate Paymaster. His Steward one day finding his bank run low, told him of it with some resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, challenging him with an over-profuse Liberality. Which notwithstanding, he remitted nothing of his accustomed Charity.

This free and beneficent tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per made his Charity sometimes liable to be abus'd, the bad effect of a good Cause.

His Style is mean and insipid, and approaches not the borders of Eloquence, it being the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, which his good Friend S. <hi>Jerom</hi> long since gave of his Writings, that learned men read them for the matter and substance, and the simple only for the sake of the style.

                        <pb n="451" facs="tcp:49523:287"/> had an Estate, and external Affairs had taken some hold of him, and he could not easily, and on a sudden break loose.

                        </note> smelt it out. The good Woman unwilling to be depriv'd of the company and assistance of such a Son, was strangely startled at it, and taking him one day by the hand, led him into her own apartment, where setting him down by her upon that very bed, whereon she had brought him forth, that what she had to say might make the more sensible impression, she burst out into some passion, and with tears in her eyes began to discourse to him in this manner. <q>Son, said she, it was but a little time (so God was pleased to order it) that I had the happiness to enjoy the vertuous and excellent conversation of your Father, whose death soon followed those pains I endured at your birth, and the same unseasonable stroke made you an Orphan, and me a Widow, and brought upon me those troubles and miseries of a Widowed state, which none can rightly understand, but they who feel them. For no Language can sufficiently represent what disturbances and inquietudes necessarily attend a young Woman, newly taken from under her Fathers roof, wholly unexperienc'd in the management of Affairs, and thrown into the midst of griefs and sorrows, too big to be born either by her strength, sex, or years. Forc'd she must be to contend with, and correct the laziness, and to watch the miscarriages of Servants, to countermine and prevent the treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Councils and Designs of Relations, to bear with the clamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous importunity, rude incivilities, and cruel usages of Collectors and Officers: Her Husband dies, and leaves a Child; if it be a Daughter, it creates the Mother no little care, though withal her education at home is both less expensive and dangerous; but if a Son, it fills her with a thousand cares and fears every day, not to speak of the Charges she must be at, that intends him a liberal Education. And yet none of these considerations have once pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd with me to alter my Condition, and bring a second Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band into your Fathers House: I have been content to be toss'd in the Storm and Tempest, and being assisted by a Power from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, have not declined the hardships of this Iron-furnace; it not being the least support to me amidst all these Sufferings, that I could daily behold your Face, and thereby had continually before my eyes the lively Image, the perfect character and resemblance of your deceased Father. 'Twas this, that while you were yet a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Infant, and before you could speak (at what time Parents take the greatest pleasure in their Children) made me look upon you with a perpetual satisfaction and delight. Nor can you lay it to my charge, that though I have generously born up under the cares of Widowhood, yet to relieve the necessities of that state I have wasted your paternal Inheritance (which yet I know in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral instances has been the hard fate and case of Orphans) no, I have preserv'd it untouch'd and intire; and yet have not spared
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:49523:288"/> any cost, to give you such an Education, as might raise you to a just esteem and reputation in the World; the Charges whereof I have defrayed out of my own Estate, and which I brought with me as my proper Portion. Think not I say this to upbraid you, the only kind requital I ask for all I have done, is, that you would not involve me in a second Widowhood, nor revive my buried grief; stay but till I am gone, 'tis like it will not be long. For those that are young, there's some hope, they may arrive at an old age; but for us that are already in years, nothing remains but a continual expectation of death. When therefore you have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted me to the ground, and laid mine besides your Fathers bones, then Travel whither you please, and cross what Seas you have a mind to, there will be none to hinder you. But while I live, be content that one House should hold us; don't so far provoke God against you, as thus miserably to afflict a Mother, that has not deserv'd it at your hands. If you think you have this against me, that I have put you upon Secular Affairs, and forc'd you to look after your own concerns; regard not the Laws of Nature, let not education, converse, or any thing else sway with you, but account me as an Enemy, and an underminer of your happiness. But if it shall appear, that I have so transacted all Affairs, as that you in the mean time may enjoy the most easie and undisturb'd course of life, though there were nothing else, let this prevail with you to stay with me. For although you may pretend there are a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand love your Company, yet there can be none that can so much minister to your ease and freedom, nor can there be any, to whom your Credit and Reputation can be equally dear, as it is to me.</q>

They spent some time in these debates, the one importuning, the other suspending his Consent, when on a sudden a rumour was spread abroad, that they were both to be made Bishops. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> was strangely surprized at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and equally divided between fear and admiration; afraid he was left the rumour should be so far true, as that the sacred Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on should be forc'd upon him; but wondered withal, how such a design should be taken up by any, especially considering his own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthiness and unsitness for it. (I might add, considering also the incompetency of his years for so grave and solemn an Office: For according to the commonly-receiv'd account of his age he could not at this time be much more than twenty one years old.)

<pb n="453" facs="tcp:49523:288"/> there was time enough to consult, and no need to come to a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent conclusion in this matter, but withal giving him some ground to believe, that if the business should go on, he would go the same way with him.

After some contest in these light Skirmishes, they next enter into the merits of the Cause, and discourse at large concerning the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and necessity, the burden and difficulty, the danger and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the Pastoral and Episcopal Office, the qualification and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour of the Persons, and the great charity of the undertaking.

Which he there presses as a notable disparagement to their cause, and a plain evidence of the excellent spirit of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, that when things were thus, even the solitary Monks left their Cells, and flockt into the City, setting themselves with one common shoulder to oppose that inundation of misery that was slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in upon it.

                        </note> themselves to the Judges and Magistrates, beseeching them to use their Authority with leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and moderation, and when told, that they were bound up by their places, and that 'twas a thing of dangerous Consequence to pass over Persons guilty of high Treason, the Monks urg'd, that they would make use however of what power they had, that when any Persons were convicted of the Fact, they would intercede with the Commissioners not to pass Sentence of Condemnation upon them, but to refer the final Issue to the Emperor's own determination, promising themselves to undertake an Embassy to Court, and to deal effectually with the Emperor about this matter. The Magistrates told them, 'twas too long a Journey for them to undertake, and that it should suffice, if they committed their Petitions to Writings, which they promis'd to convey to Court, which was afterwards done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.

But being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted by some of their train with the fame and vertues of the man, they dismounted, and embracing his knees, ask'd his pardon, and to know his mind. <hi>Friends,</hi> replyed he, <hi>Communicate this Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage to the Emperor.</hi>
                        <q>You are, Sir, not only an Emperor, but a man, look not therefore meerly on the height of your Majesty, but regard the nature you are of, and remember that being a man, you govern men like your self. The humane nature is made in the Image and likeness of God, don't you give command cruelly to destroy this Image; lest you provoke the Artist, by defacing of his Image; which you may reasonably think you shall do, when you consider to what height of passion you your self are transported only for the sake of a brazen Statue. And what a vast difference there is between a senceless Image, and one that's endued with Motion, Life, and Reason, is obvious I suppose at first sight. Let it be further considered, that it's easie with us for one Statue of Brass, to erect a thousand, but it's beyond all the Power of Empire
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:49523:291"/> and Majesty, to create but one single hair of the head of any of those Persons, whom he shall put to death.</q> The gravity of the man, and the weight of his reasonings made them listen to his discourse with great attention, which afterwards they transmitted to the Emperor.</p>
                     <p n="9">IX. THE Commissioners in the mean while applyed themselves to the Execution of their Commission, they disfranchis'd the City, abolisht their Charters and immunities, shut up all places of publick commerce, their Baths, Market-places, and Theaters, seiz'd suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Persons, especially the Nobility and those of the better sort, who had been either Authors or Aiders in the late Commotions, whom they imprison'd, and summon'd before the Courts of Judicature. Guards are set in every place, Tables of proscription affixt and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisht, and instruments of Execution made ready. Thus it was, and little better had it been even before the Commissioners arriv'd, the ordinary Magistrates bestirring themselves in their several places, so that the whole City appear'd but one continued Scene of misery and sorrow. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> to gratifie his curiosity, went one day up and down the City to take a melancholy survey of the state of things. Coming<note n="o" place="margin">Hom. <hi>XIII.</hi> p. <hi>148.</hi> &amp;c.</note> towards the Courts of Justice, he saw the little remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the City standing at the Gates, but in a profound sadness and silence, none daring to ask a Question, lest he should be the next that should be pickt out, every one with dumb signs of devotion making his address to Heaven, that God would assist the afflicted, and dispose the Judges to clemency and favour. Entring within the Court, he beheld nothing but armed Guards, Souldiers standing with Swords and Spears, to keep out the press of Women and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who with the most lamentable cries and tears came to sollicit the Bench for mercy to their Husbands and Fathers, and other near Relations, who within were in the mean time condemned, scourg'd and punisht. They threw themselves upon the ground, and with all the passionate expressions that might move pity, besought favour for their Relatives; but all in vain; the hard-hearted Souldiers drove them back, and treated them with great savageness and inhumanity. 'Twas a melancholy sight, the good man sighed, and as he went home, entertain'd himself with this meditation, "What would be the state of things at the great day, if humane Tribunals be so inexorable, that not a Mother, a Sister, a Father, though themselves innocent and unguilty of the Fact, can prevail for the Pardon of their nearest Relatives, who shall be able to stand by us before the dreadful Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Seat of Christ? Who shall plead for us at that Bar? Or be able to deliver us, when hal'd away to those everlasting punishments? The Persons here judg'd were no common Persons, but the prime Nobility of the City, and yet they would have accounted it a fair bargain, to have parted with their Estates, and their Liberties too, to have sav'd their Lives. The People daily pray'd to Heaven to incline the hearts of the Magistrates to put a present stop to these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, but the Judges went on in their Tryals and Examinations, till by the importunity and intercession of the Monks and Clergy, a respit was granted, and that no further execution should be made, till the whole Affair had been laid before the Emperor, and his Sentence were given in the case.

                        </note> upon his Journey to <hi>Constantinople.</hi> Arriving at Court, he came into the presence, but kept himself at a distance, and stood with a dejected look, and tears in his eyes, as if ashamed to be seen, or taken notice of. Whom <hi>Theodosius</hi> espying in this mournful posture, came towards him, and without any transports of passion began calmly to expostulate with him about the ingratitude of the City of <hi>Antioch,</hi> upon which throughout the whole course of his Reign he had heap'd so many Graces and Benefits, at the mention of each of which he added, <hi>and must I be thus requited for all my kindness?</hi> What evil have I done them, that they should take such a revenge? What hainous matter have they to charge upon me, that they should disgrace not only me, but the deceased? Could not their spleen and passion be satisfied with the living? Or did they think it nothing, unless they did reproach and affront the dead? Admit I had done as much injury, as they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, yet they ought to have spar'd the deceased, who had done them none, nor can they pretend to charge her with it. Did I not ever highly value and esteem that City above any other, yea beyond my own native Countrey, and was it not my constant wish, and that to whom upon all occasions I had oblig'd my self by the most solemn engagements, that I would make a personal visit to it. The good Bishop stood by, and wept plentifully, and when the Emperor had done, summon'd his reason, and began in this manner. <q>We acknowledg, Sir, with all readiness your Majesties great favour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our City, and 'tis this that puts us into mourning, that at the envious Instigation of the Devil, we have appear'd so ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to our great Benefactor, and have so much exasperated a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, who had so immense an affection for us. Though you should demolish, or burn our Houses, or kill our Persons, or do any other acts of severity, you would not take a sufficient revenge upon us. We our selves have before-hand adjudg'd our selves to what's worse than a thousand deaths. For what can be more bitter, than that when we have unjustly provoked so kind a Benefactor, the World should ring of it, and reproach us with our monstrous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude? Had the <hi>Barbarians</hi> besieg'd our City, pull'd down our Walls, or fir'd our Houses, and carried our Citizens into Captivity, this had been a far less evil: Because so long as you live, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue such a generous kindness towards us, there would be hope that these miseries would have an end, and that we might again repair and enlarge our broken Fortunes. But having now forfeited your favour, and violated your gracious protection, which was a defence to us beyond all our Walls and Bulwarks, whither shall we now fly for shelter? So benign a Lord, so indulgent a Father being disoblig'd, whence can we look for help? The things they have done are intollerable, but they have heavily punish'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, having brought themselves to that pass, that they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sham'd to look any man in the face, or so much as to lift up their eyes to behold the Sun: They have lost their Liberty, and are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:49523:292"/> more despicable than the vilest Slaves: And reflecting upon the evil Circumstances into which they have brought themselves, they are ready to sink under a sence of that dishonour which the concurrent Judgment of the whole World must needs cast upon them. But yet, Sir, if you please, this wound may be heal'd, and these evils are yet capable of a Remedy.</q> Then he proceeds to shew, <q>that great Offences have oft given occasion to the exercise of a noble and a generous Charity; that the broken Statues might be repaired, but to pardon so great Crimes in this case, was the way to erect a better, more noble, and durable representation of himself in the minds of men, and to set up as many several Images of his great Compassion and goodness, as there were, or ever should be Persons in the World: He urg'd him with the Example of the great <hi>Constantine,</hi> who when some about him perswaded him to be reveng'd on those that had abus'd his Statue, saying they had miserably battered his Face, felt with his hand about his Face, and smiling, said, <hi>I don't at all find my self bruis'd or broken, but that Head and Face are both sound and whole.</hi> An answer that ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred him famous to all Posterity beyond the Trophies of his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and all the Monuments of his Victories. He put him in mind of his own Edicts, sent into all parts for the pardoning and relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of Prisoners in the <hi>Paschal</hi> Solemnities, wherein he had testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied so heroic a Charity, that for those already executed, he wish'd he were able to bring them back to life again: That the honour of his Religion was greatly concern'd in the humanity of his Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, seeing the eyes of <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> were upon him, and would thence take the measures of it: That there was no fear o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers should by this Clemency be encourag'd to Rebellion, this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an act of Grace, not of weakness and want of Power, with which he was sufficiently furnish'd to call any to Account: That this was the way to oblige all mankind to him, and to entitle him to greater Blessings from Heaven; and that it would be an honour to him in future ages, that when he would do it at no other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, yet he would do it for God's sake, at the Petition of a poor aged Bishop, who came with this Authority to tell him from his great Master, <hi>If ye forgive men their Trespasses, your Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will also forgive you.</hi>

Nor did his care end here, but when the Bishop had taken his leave, and had crost the Sea in order to his return, not knowing what delays he might make, or what interruptions he might meet with, he sent Messengers after him to expedite his departure. And indeed so desirous was <hi>Flavian</hi> that the City should be reviv'd with the joyful news, that not being able to Travel himself fast enough, he sent the Emperor's welcome Letters by the Post, that so all Clouds of fears and sadness might be immediately dispell'd and scattered.

Many Candidates and Competitors ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared for it, and as in such cases it too often happens, the unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiest Persons, who had nothing else to recommend them, sought by Bribes and ill Arts of insinuation to oblige the great men at Court, the People in the mean time earnestly petitioning the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, that they might have a worthy Prelate plac'd over them. The man that was then most in favour at Court was <hi>Eutropius</hi> the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch, chief Chamberlain of the Pallace. He had in pursuance of the Emperor's Affairs resided for some time in the <hi>East,</hi> where he had been acquainted with <hi>Chrysostom:</hi> Him he very heartily recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to the Emperor, as a Person for his Life, Learning and Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of all others fittest for that place, but that withal, that the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair should be secretly manag'd, it being otherwise no easie matter to get him thence.

Upon these accounts he stood off, till seeing that he swam against the stream, he consented and concurr'd with the rest, especially after <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropius</hi> had threatened him, that unless he ratified the common choice, he should be himself presently brought to Tryal, there being seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral in Town ready to exhibit to the Synod a Charge of many Crimes and Enormities committed by him. Hereupon he struck Sail, and <hi>Chrysostom</hi> was consecrated and inthron'd, <hi>February</hi> the XXVI. <hi>Ann.</hi> CCCXCVIII.

He found the state of the Church within his Province through the too much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility of his Predecessor lapst into a strange degeneracy, which he resolv'd to reduce to the strictness of ancient Discipline. And first he began to inspect the manners of the Clergy<note n="x" place="margin">Pallad. ib. p. <hi>45.</hi> &amp;c.</note>, and all other Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastick Persons. A corrupt Custom had crept in amongst them to keep in their Houses Maids or Matrons, whom the Writers of the Church usually style <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

This he utterly dislik'd, and inveigh'd against as an ordinary means of temptation, or however that which furnish'd out matter for an intolerable scandal, and accordingly in two Discourses made on purpose, decries and pleads against it, not giving it over till he had quite reform'd it. Next he set upon their covetousness, and the ill arts by which they were wont to fill their Purses. He lasht their nice and intemperate Palates, their slighting their own mean Provisions, and haunting great mens Tables, where full Bellies would make way for wanton Inclinations, and not fail to bring them under the suspicion of Pick-thanks and Parasites. The Stewards of his Church he took under a strict Examination, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trencht all unnecessary Charges, enquired diligently into the Expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his Family, and finding a most profuse way of living had crept in in the time of his Predecessor, he cut it short, ordering the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plusage for the maintenance of the infirm and needy. And when a considerable stock was yet remaining, he built some Hospitals for
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:49523:294"/> the reception of the infirm and sick; over these he made two of his own Presbyters Overseers, appointing Physicians, Cooks, and other Officers to attend them, but withal taking care that they should be unmarried persons, lest the distractions or necessities of a Family should tempt them to neglect or abuse their trust. From these he proceeded to take account of the Widows, which the Church main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, whose Conversations he enquir'd into, and those of them whom he found addicted to the modes and pleasures of the age, he admonish'd either to subdue their Inclinations by Fasting and Prayer, and to abstain from the Baths, and all nice and modish Garbs, or else presently to marry, lest by their loose way of living, Religion should be expos'd to Censure and Contempt. The Laity he press'd to a more exemplary devotion, that the men whose imployments would not suffer them to attend the Church in the day time, would come at night, and there exercise themselves in Prayer and Fasting. No very welcome news to those of the Clergy, who had for some time indulg'd themselves in ease, and left off those night-offices of devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In this way he proceeded without fear or favour, those who complyed and took up, were encourag'd and commended, those who continued obstinate, he suspended, and suffered not to exercise their Offices in the Church, saying, 'twas unreasonable they should enjoy the honour and the priviledge, who would not live the lives of true Priests and Ministers.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. BUT in a sick state of Affairs he that will reform all at once, is more like to exasperate the humours, than to calm or purge them. Where there is a plethory of peccant humours, Nature must be reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by easie and gentle methods, and the Cure not be attempted by one evacuation. <hi>Chrysostom</hi>'s Zeal transported him to too quick and violent Remedies, considering the condition wherein he found things at his first coming to the Episcopal Throne. The Clergy thus sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly alarm'd and powerfully enrag'd, combin'd against him, and all their corrupt interests flowed into one common Channel. They openly traduc'd and misrepresented him to the People, and where there was but any umbrage of suspition, they improv'd it into a formal charge and calumny. But he despis'd their malice, nor did the People give any great heed to it, being infinitely delighted with the honesty of his designs, and his excellent Preaching. His Life was unblameable, his Zeal impartial, his Doctrine sound, his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons eloquent. So that the People flock'd after him in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, yea, the Dissenters themselves that were of another perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, would attend upon his Preaching, and that not without success, many of them being brought over to the Catholick Faith; amongst which we are told this memorable instance. A certain man<note n="y" place="margin">Sozom. l. <hi>8.</hi> c. <hi>5.</hi> p. <hi>764.</hi>
                        </note> of the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Sect heard him Preach concerning the holy Trinity, and was so fully convinc'd by him of the truth of that Doctrine, as not only himself to renounce his Errors, and embrace the Catholick Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, but to urge his Wife likewise to do the same. She was a great Bigot in her way, and being encourag'd by her Female Companions, plainly refused to comply with his perswasions; till at last he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned he would leave her, if she would not go with him to Church, and receive the holy Communion with him. In this strait she ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd with a Maid that waited on her, what was to be done, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:49523:295"/> them 'twas agreed to put a trick upon him. She went along with him, and at the time of the Communion, when she receiv'd the Sacramental Bread, stooping down her head, as if with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to betake her self to Prayer, she kept the Bread she had taken of the Bishop, and secretly took another piece, which her Maid, who stood by, had brought from home: Which she had no sooner put into her mouth, but it immediately became hard as a stone. The Woman was strangely surpriz'd and confounded at the accident, and her Conscience being now throughly awakned, she goes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently to the Bishop, confesses her wickedness, and shews him the Stone, bearing the impression of her teeth, and being both of an odd substance, and an unusual colour; and having with abundance of tears begg'd pardon for her fault, she ever after persever'd with her Husband in the Catholick Communion. As an evidence of all which, my Author (who liv'd and wrote there but a few years after) tells us, this very stone was preserv'd among the Rarities in the Archives of the Church of <hi>Constantinople.</hi> But to return. It was not all the malice and artifice of the Clergy, who were stung and vext with his zealous Proceedings, could lessen <hi>Chrysostom</hi>'s esteem and reputation with the People, who lik'd him never the less for it. Indeed so long as his Reproofs and Corrections went no further than the Clergy, it made no great noise; but he stay'd not here, but let fly at the wealthy and the honourable, whose pride and lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury, whose tyranny and oppression he reprov'd with the same free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and impartiality, that he did those of the meanest Tradesmen. This touch'd to the quick, and soon conjur'd up a turbulent spirit against him, that haunted him to his dying day. Among others he fell into Contest with <hi>Eutropius</hi>

A piece of Honour next to that of the Empire. But not being able to bear the weight of so much power and greatness with an even and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed mind, he let himself loose to cruelty and oppression, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus'd his Court-interest to extravagant designs. He bore hard upon Persons of all ranks and qualities, and when to avoid the effects of his Tyranny, they fled (as was usual) to take Sanctuary in the Church, priviledg'd to this purpose by the Laws of all Christian Emperors, he without any scruple violated the immunities of that holy place, and by force drew them thence. Which that he might do with some shadow of Authority, he procur'd <hi>Arcadius</hi> to pass a Law, taking away the benefit of the Churches <hi>Asylums,</hi> and giving leave to Officers to take Persons thence, who had fled thither for shelter. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> dislik'd the man, and oppos'd his Proceedings, though the others Interest was too big for him. But see how sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally the Divine Justice return'd upon him. For not long after be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing undermin'd at Court, and charg'd with affronts offered to the Empress, whom he had insolently threatned to expel the Court, and especially being petition'd against by some great ones, whose pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful demands the Emperor knew not well how to decline, he was sent for, and strip'd of all his Honours and Offices, and not daring to trust the mercy of his Enemies, was forced to fly for protection
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:49523:295"/> to that Church, which he had so lately dispoyl'd of its immunities.

                        </note> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented the vanity of all worldly honour and greatness, putting the Wretch in mind how oft he had dealt plainly with him in the time of his prosperity, when flattery and outward splendor made him deaf to all wise and sober Counsels, and slight the evils then foretold him, and which he now felt to his cost; he might now see the ingrateful returns he met with from his most passionate admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers; the multitude that had lately thronged to behold the magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of his Train, that had cryed him up with such loud Acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and whose applause he had courted with such vast Expences, were now come out with drawn Swords against him; the <hi>Circus</hi> and the Theaters, whose sports he had so oft honoured with his presence, and maintained at his Charge, and for whose sake he had so oft been angry with <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> were now become his violent Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors: While the Church, whose Priviledges he had openly inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, stretcht out her Arms, and kindly received him into her Bosom, and sent Agents all about, to endeavour his rescue out of those mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable Circumstances, into which he had plung'd himself: That if he had affronted and wronged the Church, and by Law destroyed its immunities, dear-bought experience had sufficiently rebuk'd his folly, and taught him what he had done, and himself by his practise was the first that had abolished his own Law. Not that in saying all this he insulted over the man, but warned them to be cautious by his Example, who was become the great instance of humane cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and change of Fortune: That he was desirous to allay the sharpness of that fury, wherewith they were set against him, and however it might seem a thankless Office to protect and plead for a Person, that had so lewdly trampled upon the rights of the Church, yet 'twas our duty to pardon injuries, and to <hi>be kind to the unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and to the evil;</hi> that therefore they should all joyn in a Petition for mercy, and the Emperor having sufficiently testified his readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to compassion, they in imitation of his Example should lay aside all Offences, and practice their own Prayers, <hi>to forgive, as they would be forgiven.</hi> The Discourse had its due effects upon the Auditory, the People becoming more calm and gentle, nor would the Bishop consent to deliver him up to the Emperor's Officers, till provision was made for the saving of his life. By which 'tis evident with how little pretence to truth he is reported<note n="b" place="margin">Socr. &amp; Soz. loc. cit.</note> by a scornful and petulant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vective to have triumph'd over a man in misery, when as the far greatest part of the Discourse breaths nothing but a noble and truly Christian tenderness and compassion.

                        </note> a <hi>Goth,</hi> born in <hi>Scythia</hi> not far from the River <hi>Ister,</hi> had fled over to the <hi>Romans,</hi> where from a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Souldier he by degrees arrived to be General of the Army. And being a man of a proud aspiring humour had the Empire in his eye. In order whereunto he call'd in his Countreymen the <hi>Goths,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred his Kindred to the chief places of Trust and Command in the Army. And having thus strengthened himself, committed wasts in several parts of the Empire, and struck a terror into the whole Court, which by many unreasonable Concessions sought to oblige and gain him by fair means. At length an interview was appointed between him and the Emperor, they met at <hi>Chalcedon</hi> in the Church of S. <hi>Euphemia</hi> the Martyr, where having given their oaths for mutual se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, they began to treat, and <hi>Gainas</hi> seeming to comply with the Emperor, went over with him to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where finding his Affairs to succeed prosperously enough, he proceeded to more inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent demands. He was by his Religion, as all the Christian <hi>Goths</hi> were, an <hi>Arian,</hi> and being instigated by his own Ambition, and prompted by the Churchmen of his party, required of the Emperor, that one of the City Churches might be given to him, and the men of his Communion, it being unfit, he said, that so great a man as the General should be forced to go out of Town to his Devotions. The Emperor, a man of a soft and cowardly temper, promised he would advise upon it, and do what he could to gratifie him in it, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon sent for <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> and acquainted him with the General's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, telling him withal, that he was an over-powerful Person, and a man of dangerous designs, and therefore desired that by granting his request, he would sweeten and allay his fury. The Bishop re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, <hi>Sir, I beseech you promise no such matter, nor command holy things to be given to dogs: For I will never yield, that those who preach and magnify God the Son should be cast out, and the holy Church be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered up to those who disparage and blaspheme him. And be not, Sir, afraid of this</hi> Barbarian, <hi>but call us both before you, and while you sit si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent by, I will so stop his mouth, that thenceforth he shall make no more such unreasonable demands.</hi> The Emperor was glad of this expedient, and the next day sent for both of them to Court, <hi>Chrysostom</hi> coming attended with all the Bishops that were then in Town. Assoon as they were come into the presence, <hi>Gainas</hi> began to claim his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise; but this, the Bishop told him, an Emperor that profess'd Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, could not grant, nor might take upon him thus to intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in the things of God. The General answered, 'twas but fit he
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:49523:296"/> should be allowed a Church for his Devotions. For that, said the Bishop, all the Church-doors are open for you, and no man hinders you from praying where you please. But I, replyed <hi>Gainas,</hi> am of another way, and desire but one Church for me and my Party to assemble in: A request which I may reasonably make, who have fought so many Battels, and undergone so many dangers for the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. True, said <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> but you have had Rewards far beyond your Services. You are General of the Army, and have the priviledge to be cloathed with <hi>Consular</hi> Ornaments. You should do well to remember what you once was, and what you are now, your former poverty, and your present plenty, how you were clad, when you first pass'd the River <hi>Ister,</hi> and what you have now upon your back. Remember how inconsiderable are your Services, compar'd with the largeness of your Rewards, and be not ingrateful to those that have thus honoured and advanc'd you. He put him in mind of his Oaths<note n="f" place="margin">Sozom. ib. p. <hi>761.</hi>
                        </note> and Engagements, the fealty he had sworn to the Empire, and the obedience he had promised to those Laws, which he now so insolently attempted to trample under foot. And to strike the matter dead at once, he pluck'd out a Law of <hi>Theodosius,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting Hereticks to hold their Assemblies within the City. And then turning to the Emperor, perswaded him to ratify and execute this Law against all other Hereticks, advising rather to lay down the Empire, than impiously to betray the Church of God.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. BUT <hi>Gainas</hi> though baffled, was not satisfied. For seeing himself defeated of his ends, he was no longer able to master his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, but broke out into open Rebellion. And first he intended to seize the shops of the Bankers, but they upon intimation, had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn and hid their Money. Then he sent some of his <hi>Goths</hi> by night to set fire to the Pallace, but they frighted with the Apparition of an Army of tall Souldiers, fled back, and he went himself the next night along with them, and found it so. With that he left the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and endeavoured privately to convey away great numbers of Arms, which being seiz'd and search'd at the Gates, brought the whole Conspiracy to light. Hereupon a Proclamation is issued out, denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing <hi>Gainas</hi> a Traytor, and commanding the <hi>Goths</hi> whom he had left behind him in the City, to be put to death. Seven thousand of them fled for Sanctuary into the great Church that stood next the Pallace, where the Emperor commanded them to be killed, not thinking it reasonable that any place should protect such notorious Rebels from the stroke of Justice. But none durst attempt either to attaque them there, or to pluck them thence, not knowing to what outragious ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects so hopeless and forlorn a condition might drive desperate Persons. Whereupon Persons were imploy'd to untile that part of the Church that was over the Communion Table, whence they threw down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them pieces of Wood set on fire, till they had destroy'd them, to the no little Prophanation of that holy place in the judgment of all sober and pious Christians, as the Heathen Historian<note n="g" place="margin">Zosim. l. <hi>5.</hi> p. <hi>796.</hi>

But in so good a Cause he feard no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and without any demurr, betook himself to his Journey.

                        </note> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon the Bishop, and kneeling before him, begg'd the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposal of his Authority, that he would stand by a company of innocent Persons, unjustly oppressed by those, who designed nothing but their ruin. The Bishop beholding a company of grave venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Persons, to the number of fifty, thus before him, rose up, and with tears in his eyes asked them, what hard fate had driven them thither. They requesting him to take his Chair, told him, that they had been wounded by the fury and malice of <hi>Theophilus,</hi> and desired his help to cure them, unless he also should refuse to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate on their behalf: Which if he should, as other Bishops had done, either out of fear or favour to <hi>Theophilus,</hi> they had no other way left them, but to address to the Emperor, where they must be forc'd to publish his vile and unwarrantable doings to the scandal of the Church: If therefore he had any regard to the Churches Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he should perswade him to suffer them to return, and dwell quietly in their own Countrey, they having neither offended him, nor violated the Laws of their Religion. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> willingly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook in due time to intercede for them, and in the mean time assigned them lodgings adjoyning to the Church called <hi>Anastasia,</hi> where partly by their own hand-labour, partly by the Charity of others, and especially <hi>Olympias,</hi> they were supplyed with all neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Provisions and Accommodations. But though <hi>Chrysostom</hi> treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with great humanity, and permitted them to come to the publick prayers, yet would he not communicate with them, till their Cause had been heard and tryed. Nor did they want favour
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:49523:297"/> and assistance at Court<note n="m" place="margin">Soz. loc. supr. cit.</note>; for having made known their case to the Empress, she entertained them with singular respect, and espying them as she pass'd through the Street, commanded the Chariot to stop, and looking out bow'd to them, and desired their blessing, and that they would pray for the Emperor, for her self and Children, and for the happiness of the Empire, assuring them she would take care, that a Synod should be shortly called, and that <hi>Theophilus</hi> should be summoned to it.</p>
                     <p n="7">VII. By this time Messengers were arrived from <hi>Alexandria,</hi> whom <hi>Theophilus</hi> had sent to manage his Cause, and to make an interest for him with the Governors that were to be sent into <hi>Aegypt. Chrysostom</hi> sent for them to come to him, enquiring of them whether they knew the Monks that were then in Town: They replyed, they did, and confessed they had had hard measure, but pray'd that whatever kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness else he might shew them, he would not out of respect to <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ophilus</hi> admit them to Communion. Hereupon he wrote in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half to <hi>Theophilus,</hi> that he would recal the men, and receive them into favour. This <hi>Theophilus</hi> refused, and sent back Messengers fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with Libels of accusation against them, and who might insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate at Court ill suspitions of them. The Monks perceived now all hopes of reconciliation desperate, and therefore taking some Persons of Quality along with them, they went to the Bishop, and having with an <hi>Anathema</hi> renounced the <hi>Origenian</hi> Heresie, delivered into his hands a Libel, containing an account of <hi>Theophilus</hi> his Tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal proceedings, with other Articles of impeachment which they gave in against him. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> both by himself and other Bishops disswaded them from this way, advising them to suppress their Charge, and wrote a second time to <hi>Theophilus,</hi> to let him know what the Monks had done, desiring him to write back what he thought best to be done in this matter, for that he could not prevail with the Monks to lay down their charge, or keep them from exhibiting their complaints at Court. The man was nettled to the quick, and though he made a shift to stifle the height of his resentment, could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to give a tast of it in this tart Letter, which he sent back to <hi>Chrysostom. I suppose you are not ignorant of the Canons of the</hi> Nicene <hi>Council, which provide, that no Bishop shall judge Causes out of his own Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction. If you know not this, then learn it, and cease to receive Libels against me. For if I must be judg'd, it's much fitter it should be done by Bishops in</hi> Aegypt, <hi>than by them, who are</hi> LXXV. <hi>days Journey distant from us. Chrysostom</hi> receiv'd the Letter, and laid it by, and perswaded both Parties to agree, who yet, as it commonly happens in such ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, went both of them away dissatisfied and discontented. All which passages relating to these <hi>Origenist</hi>-Monks, were transacted <hi>Ann.</hi> CCCC. and the following year, what further ensued upon it, shall be related in its due time and place.</p>

                     <p n="2">II. THE People were now dismist, and <hi>Chrysostom</hi> and the rest taking their places in the <hi>Baptistery,</hi> called for <hi>Eusebius,</hi> and renewed to him his former motion, adding, that if he did know things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he might accuse him (for as they would not reject him, if he desired it, so neither would they force him to it, if he had not a mind to it) he should consider what was most fit to be done before the Accusation was read; for after it was once publish'd, and spread abroad, and entered upon the Register, he could not then recede or be discharg'd. But he persisting in his Resolution, the Libel was read in every Article. Which done, the senior Bishops moved the President, that though all the Articles were bad enough, yet that for the gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of time, they might insist only upon the most Capital, the Charge of Simony, and if that was made good, there would be little reason to dispute the other. This was agreed to, so the Tryal began, and <hi>Chrysostom</hi> ask'd <hi>Antoninus,</hi> what he could say for himself? He stout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denyed the Charge, and the Bishops that were challeng'd so to have procured their Consecration, being likewise interrogated, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed the Fact. Eight hours were spent in canvasing the case <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> when at last the Witnesses were call'd for, who were pretended to have been present when the Money was paid. But the most ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Evidences were not there. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> therefore finding it would be a difficult matter to determine it at this distance, resolved upon a Journey thither, that he might with more advantage examine things upon the place. <hi>Antoninus</hi> was startled at this, he knew <hi>Chrysostom</hi> to be a man of resolution, and of a most equal and unbiast temper, and had no other way to prevent it, but by addressing himself to a great man at Court, whose Estate in <hi>Asia</hi> he managed for him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeching him to procure <hi>Chrysostom</hi>'s Journey to be stop'd, engaging that the Witnesses should be brought to Town. Immediately came
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:49523:299"/> an Order from Court, to let <hi>Chrysostom</hi> know, that in this distracted state of Affairs, his presence could not well be spared, and that 'was needless to take so long a Journey, when Witnesses might be easily brought to Town. Glad was <hi>Antoninus</hi> he had gain'd this point, knowing of what huge importance to his Affairs the least delay would be, as furnishing him with an opportunity to tamper with the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, whom he doubted not either by his power or interest to take off. This <hi>Chrysostom</hi> was aware of, and therefore presently summon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Synod, they ordered three of their number to go out of hand into <hi>Asia,</hi> to take the Examination of Witnesses. <hi>Syncletius</hi> Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan of <hi>Trajanople, Hesychius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Parium,</hi> and <hi>Palladius</hi> of <hi>Helenople</hi> were the Persons pitch'd on for this errand; but <hi>Hesychius</hi> secretly favouring <hi>Antoninus,</hi> excus'd himself upon pretence of sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. <hi>Hypaepae</hi> a City of <hi>Asia</hi> was the place appointed for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners sitting, as being nearest to those Persons that were to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and a power was given them, that whosoever upon summons should not appear within two months, should stand excommunicate. The Commissioners being dispatch'd, went to <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and issued out their Warrants to signifie their arrival, citing all Persons concerned of either party to appear at the place appointed. But they found fraud and foul dealing on all hands; for the Prosecutors had been brib'd off, and engag'd by Oaths not to Prosecute, and hop'd to wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry out the Judges by delaying the Evidence, pretending they were not presently to be found. The Commissioners call'd for <hi>Eus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

He supposing they would not be able long to endure the extream heat of the season, answered he would produce them within forty days, or be content to undergo the penalty inflicted by the Canons. So they waited, while he pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to go seek his Witnesses, fled directly to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and there conceal'd himself, and not appearing at the time prefix'd, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners wrote to the Bishops of <hi>Asia,</hi> and denounc'd him Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate. After which they stay'd thirty days longer, and none appearing, they returned back to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where they met <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius,</hi> whom when they challeng'd with his persidious dealings, he pretended indisposition and want of health, but promised that he would still produce his Witnesses.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. THE Controversie was thus bandied up and down, when <hi>Antoninus</hi> the subject of the quarrel, departed this Life, after whose death the Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> was in a more deplorable case than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whereof the Clergy of that Church, and the neighbouring Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops certified <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> and besought him to lay to his helping hand, which they did by this address. <hi>Forasmuch as heretofore we have been governed disorderly, and contrary to the Rules and Canons made by the ancient Fathers, we beseech your reverence, that you would come down hither, and settle this so long afflicted and distracted Church; the</hi> Arians <hi>infesting us on the one side, and the covetousness and ambition of some of our own no less disturbing us on the other. For there are a great many that like ravenous Wolves lye at catch, and greedily endeavour by Bribes to invade and usurp this See.</hi> This Letter found <hi>Chrysostom</hi> in no good state of health, and the Winter-season (for such it now was, it being the latter end of the year. CCCXCIX.) rendered him yet
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:49523:299"/> less unfit for such a Journey. But resolving to make all private and personal Considerations stoop to the publick Interest, he took ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and after a very dangerous passage came to <hi>Apamia,</hi> where <hi>Palladius, Cyrinus</hi> and <hi>Paulus,</hi> whom he had chosen for the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of his Journey, waited his arrival. Hence they went on foot to <hi>Ephesus,</hi> whither he sent for the Bishops of <hi>Lydia, Caria,</hi> and the <hi>proconsular Asia,</hi> though there little needed any formal Summons, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral flocking thither meerly to enjoy the Company and Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this great man. There met to the number of LXX. Bishops, with whom he entered into consultation about the state of those Churches. To this Synod came <hi>Eusebius</hi> of <hi>Valentinople,</hi> the late fierce accuser of <hi>Antoninus,</hi> humbly petitioning, that he might be restored to Communion. Many of the Synod were against it, plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that he had been thrown out for calumny and detraction. But he press'd his suit, and told them, that for as much as the Cause had been under debate for almost two years, and that the delay of the Witnesses had been the only reason that had hindered it from coming to a final issue, he besought them now to examine the Witnesses, who were ready to appear. And although <hi>Antoninus,</hi> who had taken the Bribes was dead, yet the Persons that had given them, and been or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained upon it, were still alive. The Synod agreed to take the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness under consideration, and the Registers were produc'd, and the whole Proceedings read before them. Then the Witnesses were brought in, and the Persons charg'd with Simony cited, who at first denyed it, till the Witnesses (who were not only Lay-men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, but Presbyters, their own Friends and Confidents) deposing as to time and place, and the Sums paid, and the very <hi>speci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

As to their being discharged in Court <hi>Chrysostom</hi> undertook it, promising the Synod he would intercede with the Emperor, whereupon the Council ordered that <hi>Antoninus</hi> his Heirs should make Restitution: And as for themselves, they should have liberty to Communicate within the Chancel, but should be, and be look'd upon only as Persons that had once been Bishops. They being depos'd, others who were men of parts and integrity were planted in their rooms, who yet about four years after, when <hi>Chrysostom</hi>'s Affairs went down the wind, were ejected, and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer brought in again.

But the People were hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly discontented at it, even to rage and madness, they did nothing but recount his praises, and the benefits they had received by him, and as men are wont to do in some dreadful Calamity, ran up and down the streets both there and at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> singing Hymns, and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, that they might have him for their Bishop. The Synod being dissolved, <hi>Chrysostom</hi> left these parts, having depos'd in all six Bishops, which the malice of his Enemies afterwards improved to sixteen; and though <hi>Sozomen</hi> says there were thirteen, yet 'tis much more reasonable to believe <hi>Palladius,</hi> who was present at the whole trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action from first to last, and appeals to the publick Records for the truth of it.</p>

He resolved therefore to countermine them in their own way, and to that end composed certain Hymns containing the Catholick Doctrine, which he delivered to his People to be sung the same night. And that the business might be manag'd with the greater Pomp and Solemnity, Crosses of Silver were made at the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses Charge, and lighted Torches born before them, and <hi>Briso</hi> the Empresses own Eunuch as <hi>Praecentor</hi> walked before the Company.

<pb n="477" facs="tcp:49523:300"/> thus out-done both in number and splendor, fell upon the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks in their Procession, in which conflict some were slain on both sides, and <hi>Briso</hi> himself dangerously wounded in the Forehead. To prevent which disorders, <hi>Arcadius</hi> forbad the <hi>Arians</hi> to assemble in this manner, and lest the Catholicks in the sole possession of this way of <hi>Antiphonal</hi> Procession, a custom which continued many years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

He ordained some of that Country Readers, Deacons and Presbyters, and assign'd them a Church within the City, by whose industry he reclaim'd many to the Catholick Church. And that his design might succeed better, he himself went often and preacht there, making use of an Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to convey his Discourse to the People, and prevailed with the most eloquent Preachers about the Town to do the like. And under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that the <hi>Scythian Nomadae</hi> that dwelt beyond <hi>Ister</hi> were great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dispos'd to entertain the Gospel, but were destitute of any to preach it to them, he procured Persons to undertake that work, and wrote to the Bishops that bordered upon those parts to assist in it, and furnish out fit Persons, who might carry on the Conversion of those Countries. It griev'd him not a little, when he was told that even in <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> a Countrey that lay within the heart of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, <hi>Pagan</hi> Idolatry was still the Paramount Religion. For the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation whereof he engaged a Company of zealous Monks, whom he sent into those parts, and that they might not go without the Royal Authority, he procured an Edict from the Emperor, impow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them to pull down and destroy all the Pagan Temples. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause 'twas a matter of Charge as well as Difficulty, he did not think fit to burden the Exchequer with it, but perswaded several rich and pious Matrons to furnish out the Expences at their own Charge. But though for the present things succeeded well, yet not long after the <hi>Gentiles</hi> made Head against them, defended their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and slew many of the Monks, and wounded more. The exact time of his setting on foot this excellent design I cannot precisely fix; though whether it was done <hi>Ann.</hi> CCCC. or immediately upon his advancement to the See of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> is not very material to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</p>

Whereupon he was acquitted by the Assembly, who also interceded with <hi>Severian</hi> for a reconciliation, and <hi>Chrysostom</hi> that he might shew how ready he was to give any reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able satisfaction, suspended <hi>Serapio</hi> from his Office for the space of a Week. As for the words spoken by <hi>Severian,</hi> which <hi>Serapio</hi> proved before the Assembly, some of his Friends pleaded for him, that his Enemies mangled his words, and suppressing the former part, charg'd him with asserting, that Christ was never made man; but <hi>Chrysostom</hi> answered, that taking the whole together, 'twas bad enough, for though <hi>Serapio</hi> should, or should not dye a Christian, yet it followed not thence, that Christ was not made man. After all, the meeting came to no conclusion, <hi>Severian</hi> was obstinate, and would comply with nothing, unless <hi>Serapio</hi> were not only put from his Office, but excluded all Communion. Whereupon <hi>Chrysostom</hi> rose up in some heat, and bad the Bishops judge the Cause, for that for his part he would meddle no further in it. But with him they all rose up, and went away, and so the Consistory broke up, with some reflection upon <hi>Severian,</hi> for his unreasonable obstinacy and perverseness. Soon after <hi>Chrysostom</hi> advis'd him to be gone home, sending him this Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, that it was not fit that he should so notoriously neglect his Charge, and that the Church committed to him should for so long a time be destitute of the care and presence of its Bishop; that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he should immediately return thither, and improve the Talents and Abilities God had given him in his own Sphere and Station. With which smart admonition he left <hi>Constantinople.</hi> The Empress <hi>Eudoxia</hi> was angry at what was done, and sent for <hi>Severian,</hi> who was retired to <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> to come back, but <hi>Chrysostom</hi> refused any converse with him, till the Empress being resolved to make Peace, took up the young Prince <hi>Theodosius, Chrysostom</hi>'s God-son, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying him in her Arms into the Church, lay'd him down at the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop's feet, and for his sake besought him to be Friends with <hi>Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</hi> which at last she obtained. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> hereupon made an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

And first they sent Spies to <hi>Antioch,</hi> to hunt after the miscarriages of his younger days, but finding nothing there upon the strictest scrutiny they could make, they bethought themselves of <hi>Theophilus</hi> at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> who they knew bore no good will to <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> and who had a head fitted to contrive and carry on such designs. To him they write about it, who received the message with both hands, as an opportunity he had long wished for of venting his spleen against him, encreas'd of late by the favour <hi>Chrysostom</hi> had shew'd to the Monks whom he had driven out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and whom it was reported <hi>Chrysostom</hi> had not only been otherwise very kind to, but that he had admitted them to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. And as if there had been a conspiracy of Accidents as well as Persons, his affairs at this time seemed to lye fair for such a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. For having Synodically condemned the <hi>Origenian</hi> Heresie (as they then called it) and procured <hi>Epiphanius</hi> to do the like in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> he had engaged that good old man to carry the Decrees to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and to sollicit <hi>Chrysostom</hi> to enter into this quarrel, and to prosecute the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Monks (whom they unjustly charged with <hi>Origenism</hi>) but with what success, has been related in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> had in vain mediated with <hi>Theophilus</hi> on their behalf, whereupon they had impeached him, and he recriminated up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and had sent his Legates to <hi>Constantinople</hi> to manage his Cause against them. The <hi>Origenian</hi> Monks growing weary of delays, petitioned the Empress, that the Libels which the adverse Party had preferred against them to the Provost of the City might be examined, that <hi>Theophilus</hi> might be summon'd, and undergoe his Tryal, and that his Messengers might either prove their Charge, or suffer the Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in that case provided against false Accusers. This request was thought reasonable, and in pursuance of it <hi>Elaphius</hi> a great Officer at Court was dispatched with Orders to <hi>Alexandria</hi> to bring up <hi>Theophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus.</hi> The Judges in the mean time proceeded in the Cause of his Legates, who had accused the Monks, and the Legates being found guilty of Calumny and Subornation, and seeing themselves exposed to the present lash of the Laws, threw the whole blame upon <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ophilus</hi> as the sole Author and Contriver of it, and were thereupon cast into Prison, where some of them dyed, others after his arrival were by his interest banished into <hi>Preconessus.</hi>

There were those at Church that took Notes, which they carried to the Empress, who presently applyed them to her self, and complained to the Emperor of the publick affront of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to her. Besides, the main of the discourse being general, most of the great Ladies about the Town reckoned themselves concerned in it.

And without taking any notice of <hi>Chrysostom</hi> (as if the See had been actually void) he sent for his Arch-deacon, and by him endeavoured to bring over the Clergy to him. So that the City Churches began to be empty, and the Clergy were brought daily to him, and perswaded to accuse their Bishop, and exhibit Libels against him. Two more especially he met with, fit instruments for his purpose, who had been turned out by <hi>Chrysostom</hi> for the most enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Offences, the one for Murder, the other for Adultery; these he instructed how to bring in their Charge, promising them (and he was as good as his word) that he would in due time restore them to their Station in the Ministry. All this while <hi>Chrysostom</hi> was at a stand what to do, he treated him with mild and obliging Messages, and desired to know what he meant by these turbulent courses, but in vain: On the other hand he was mightily importun'd by <hi>Theophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> his Accusers, to proceed judicially against him, the Emperor himself sending for him, and commanding him to go to <hi>Theophilus,</hi> and there to examine the Causes, and hear the most heavy Crimes that were charg'd upon him. But he remembred the Canons, which <hi>Theophilus</hi>'s Letters had also put him in mind of, that Ecclesiastical mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were to be judg'd within their own Provinces, and were not to be drawn before a Forreign Judicature, and was therefore unwilling to meddle in it.</p>

That he had called S. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> a <hi>doting</hi> man, and a <hi>little Fiend.</hi> VII. That he had devised mischief against <hi>Severian,</hi> and had set up the <hi>Decani,</hi> or Sextons against him. VIII. That he had written a whole Book stuffed with nothing but Falshoods and Calumnies against the Clergy. IX. That calling a Convention of his whole Clergy, he had Indicted three of his Deacons, <hi>Acacius, Edaphius,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> and had charged them with stealing the Pall that he used to wear about his shoulders, insinuating as if they had taken it to some unlawful use. X. That he had Ordain'd one <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> Bishop, who yet stood convict of violating the Tombs and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of the dead. XI. That in a mutiny of the Souldiers he had discovered and betrayed <hi>Count John.</hi> XII. That he was not wont to make his prayers either as he went to, nor at his entrance into the Church. XIII. That he Ordained Deacons and Presbyters in other places, and not within the Chancel. XIV. That he made four seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Bishops at one Ordination. XV. That he entertained Women, and convers'd with them alone, all others being shut out of the Room. XVI.

That the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues of the Church were dispos'd of, and no man knew which way they went. XVIII.

That he had taken Persons whom all the rest of the World admitted to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and at his arbitrary pleasure had thrown them into Prison, and when they dyed there, had neglected them, and not taken so much care as that their Bodies should be interr'd.

That he struck <hi>Mamnon</hi> with his Fist in the Church of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> so that blood gush'd out of his mouth, and yet went on to Consecrate the holy Eucharist. XXVIII. That he was wont to be dress'd and undress'd upon the Bishop's Throne, and there used to eat the little Cake (this was to prevent spitting after the reception of the Sacrament.) XXIX.

Make hast therefore to come hither, and bring along with you</hi> Sarapion <hi>and</hi> Tigrius, <hi>Presbyters, for whom there will be occasion.</hi> This Summons being read, the whole Company were offended at it, but told the Bishops that brought it, they would return an answer to <hi>Theophilus</hi> by Messengers of their own, to whom they accordingly wrote to this effect. <q>Presume not to intrench upon and disturb the Churches affairs, nor to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Order; rend not the Church, for which Christ came down from Heaven. But if you will be so rash and hasty, as to lay aside the Canons of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, and take upon you to hear Causes without your own Jurisdiction, come hither to us into this well-regulated City, and provoke us not as <hi>Cain</hi> did <hi>Abel</hi> to go into the Field, that we may in the first place hear what you have to say for your self. For we have Libels against you, containing no less than LXX. Articles, and those charg'd with the most open and scandalous Offences. And for number, we that are here as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled by the grace of God for the peace, not the destruction of the Church, are more than you. For your Synod consists but of XXXVI. Bishops, most whereof come out of one Province, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we are forty, met out of several Provinces, and seven of that number <hi>Metropolitans.</hi> And 'tis agreeable both to Reason and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom, that in matters of this nature the lesser number should be concluded by the <hi>Major,</hi> and by the more eminent part. We have also your own Letter, wherein you admonish our Colleague <hi>John</hi> not to meddle with Judging a Bishop out of his own Province. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore submit your selves to the Canons of the Church, and rather intercede with your Accusers, to let fall the Charge they have brought against you, or at least take them off from troubling <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom</hi> with their Complaints.</q> This answer being drawn up, <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom</hi> told them, that they might send what Message they thought good, but for his own part he was resolv'd to return a particular answer to <hi>Theophilus,</hi> which was in substance this<note n="k" place="margin">Chrys. Ep. ad Innoc. p. <hi>678.</hi>
                        </note>, <q>That he did not decline being brought to Tryal, but only refus'd to be Judg'd by a profest and declared Enemy. For he who before ever he had received any Libels, had from the very first given such plain evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent instances of partiality and dissatisfaction, abstain'd from the Prayers and Communion of the Church, suborn'd Accusers, drawn over the Clergy to him, and made the Church desolate, how was he ever like to prove a fair and equal Judge, and sit to ascend a
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:49523:305"/> Tribunal, no ways agreeable to him. For 'tis not reasonable, that a man that lives in <hi>Aegypt</hi> should Judg those that dwyll in <hi>Thrace,</hi> and this man too himself lying under an Accusation, and withal an open Adversary to those whom he is Judg: that for his own part he openly declared, that as he was innocent, so he was most ready to assert his innocency, and to answer the Allegations brought against him before an hundred, or a thousand Bishops; that<note n="l" place="margin">Pallad. p. <hi>72.</hi>
                           </note> he stood not upon the place, where he should be Tryed, though he thought it most fit to be within the City; they were the Persons of the Judges he excepted against, particularly against <hi>Theophilus</hi> himself, who had said both at <hi>Alexandria</hi> and in <hi>Lycia,</hi> that he was going to Court to depose <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> which he demonstrated at his arrival by refusing all manner of Familiarity or Communion with him. And he who shew'd himself an Enemy before the Trial, what would he be at, and after it? He excepted likewise against <hi>Acacius,</hi> who had threatned, that he would <hi>season his pot for him:</hi> That for <hi>Severian</hi> and <hi>Antiochus,</hi> 'twas needless to say any thing, their misdemeanours being expos'd upon the publick Theaters, and no doubt Divine Vengeance would quickly overtake them. If therefore, <hi>said he,</hi> you be really desirous that I should appear, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge these four from being Judges; if they be only Accusers, let them be brought in, that I may know in what Circumstances I am like to be, and whether I am to appear before them as Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries, or as Judges, and then I am most willing to appear not before them only, but before a General Council. And take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that though you should send me a thousand Summons, I am resolved to return no other answer.</q>

In answer whereunto he sent some others of his Bishops to expostulate with them to this purpose, with what reason or order they could pretend to judge him, who would not dismiss his Enemies from amongst them, and who took upon them to cite him by those of his own Clergy. But so far were his answers from being satisfactory, that the Bishops who carried them were treated with an uncommon savageness and inhumanity, one beaten, another pull'd and torn, a third had those very Irons clap'd upon his Neck, which they had prepared for <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> to have loaded him with as he was to be sent on Shipboard, and transmitted to some obscure corner of the World. Which the good Bishop hearing of, kept close where he was. But it's time we now return back to the Synod.</p>

That he had taken other mens Servants before they were emancipated, while they lay under Accusations, and had made them Bishops. XI. That he had oft misus'd <hi>Isaacius</hi> himself, who preferr'd this Charge. But of this last Charge, they discuss'd no more than the first and the fourth Articles; from whence they went back to the third Article of the former Charge, which concerned the sale of the Church-Jewels and Ornaments, and for the proof of this they produc'd <hi>Arsacius, Atticus,</hi> and <hi>Elpidius,</hi> who also together with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacius</hi> deposed to the fourth Article.

And he was willing to be at peace with the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Monks, could they but be brought to any shew of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and submission, that might seem to justify his fierce Zeal against them. To this purpose Agents were set on work, who represented to them how ready <hi>Theophilus</hi> was to pardon what was past, if they would but sue for it, and that the Synod did intercede for them. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured with these smooth Pretences, and desirous after all to sit down in quiet, they yielded to say, what they were wont to do when they received the greatest injuries, <hi>Forgive us.</hi> Upon which easie terms <hi>Theophilus</hi> readily received them into favour, and readmitted them to Communion. Which perhaps had not been so tamely assent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, had the two Brothers, <hi>Dioscorus</hi> and <hi>Ammonius,</hi> the prime sticklers of the Party been alive.

Here he took up his Quarters, protesting he would not go into the City, till he could vindicate his innocency before a greater Synod, than that wherein he had been condemned. But the People were impatient of delays, and began to murmur openly, and throw the fault upon the Court, which therefore used all its Artifices to bring him home, to which he had no sooner yielded, but the Empress sent<note n="c" place="margin">Serm. ubi supr. p. <hi>974,</hi>
                        </note> to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement him, that now her Prayers were heard, and the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion accomplished which she had so passionately begg'd for; that she looked upon it as a greater Glory than the Crown she wore, that she had recovered her Bishop, that she had restored the Head to the Body, the Pilot to the Ship, the Pastor to his Flock, and the Bridegroom to his nuptial Bed; that those that had invaded and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed it, were ashamed; and that now she had done this, she cared not much whether she lived or dyed. He was met on the way by crowds of People, who sung Hymns prepared on purpose for this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, others carried lighted Torches in their hands, and in this joyful and splendid Equipage they brought him to his Cathedral, where they importun'd him to ascend the Episcopal Throne, and give them his Blessing. He told them he was disabled, being under a Censure, that the Judges that had condemned him must reverse their Sentence, and restore him to his See. This denial did but the more sharpen the Peoples unsatisfied desires, who prest him to it with greater vehemency, till finding that nothing else would quiet them, went up, and in the accustomed form pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced <hi>the Peace</hi> to the People. And seeing them still desirous of something more, he made an <hi>extempore</hi> Oration<note n="d" place="margin">Ext. ubi supr. p. <hi>969.</hi> &amp; ap. Georg. Alex. in vit.

A Case which he draws out into a very ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Comparison. And taking occasion, as he had good reason, to commend the kindness and forwardness both of Prince and People, he so inflamed the affections of his Auditors, that bursting out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to shouts and acclamations in honour of the Emperor and his Lady <hi>Eudoxia,</hi> they forced him somewhat abruptly to break off his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. A very eloquent discourse, which though <hi>Baronius</hi> bewails as lost, yet is it still extant, being together with his former preserved by <hi>George</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> in the account he has given of <hi>Chrysostom</hi>'s Life, being the most considerable and valuable piece of that Life.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. <hi>THEOPHILƲS</hi> we may imagine was sorely vexed at these Proceedings. A great mind he had to charge <hi>Chrysostom</hi> publickly with acting contrary to the Canons, in exercising his Episcopal Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, after he had been depos'd. But he was afraid to disoblige the Emperor and the great ones at Court, who he saw were forced to humour the People. Therefore he resolved to begin with <hi>Heraclides</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> whose Accusers he cited, and formed a Process against him. His Friends pleaded, that it was not consonant to the
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:49523:308"/> Laws either of Church or State, to sit upon and condemn a man that was absent, and unable to speak for or defend himself. But <hi>Theophilus</hi> and his Party resolved to proceed, as the others did to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose his Proceedings, and the Contest grew so high between the <hi>Egyptians</hi> that sided with <hi>Theophilus,</hi> and the People of <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> that it came to blows, and some were wounded, and others slain in the quarrel. Affrighted with this riot, <hi>Severian</hi> and the rest of the Bishops of that gang fled out of Town, and <hi>Theophilus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self not knowing to what this might grow, and understanding that a Council was suddenly to be called to recanvass and discuss matters, took shipping at midnight, and set Sayl for home.

But he had no mind to it, and accordingly excus'd himself upon pretence he was afraid of a Tumult in his absence, as indeed the People even before the Emperor's Letters came, had entertained him with a thousand Sarcasms and Reproaches. However there assembled at <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> LX. odd Bishops, who took the Proceedings of the former Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod under a review, revers'd the Acts of it, and intirely restored <hi>Chrysostom</hi> to his See, who about the same time preferr'd his Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Serapion</hi> to the Bishoprick of <hi>Heraclea.</hi>

For <hi>Christmas-day</hi> now approaching, the Emperor (easily managed by <hi>Eudoxia,</hi> and others about him) came not as he was wont to Church, but sent <hi>Chrysostom</hi> word, that he could not communicate with him, till he had cleared himself of the Crimes that had been objected to him. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> desired nothing more, and publickly challeng'd his Accusers to make good their Charge. But they had not the hardiness to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon it. And therefore <hi>Leontius</hi> and <hi>Ammonius</hi> privately ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted <hi>Acacius</hi> and <hi>Antiochus,</hi> that the best way was to let go the old Charge, and to insist only upon this, that being Synodically de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, he had of his own head without sufficient Authority repos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd himself of his See. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> replied, that at his return he had been reinstated by the Votes of LXV.

And indeed it must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd, that though the <hi>Major</hi> part of Bishops in that Council were Catholicks, and the Council it self be received into the <hi>Code</hi> of the universal Church, yet was there an active Party in that Synod, who were either profess'd <hi>Arians,</hi> or such as favoured that Cause, and who got some Canons so framed, as might best serve their turn, promote their Designs, and warrant their Proceedings against <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius.</hi> But still this must be acknowledged to have been only an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer <hi>ad hominem,</hi> which he might the freelier make use of, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of <hi>Antioch</hi> not being as yet admitted into the Ecclesiastick <hi>Code,</hi> though they were soon after. The truth is, he was not really with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Charge of the <hi>Antiochian</hi> Canons, having according to them been Canonically examined, acquitted, and re-admitted, and had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly before truly told them, that he had been restored, by a far greater Synod, than that whereby he had been deposed and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.</p>

For neither before had he been rightly depos'd, but forcibly carried away by the Imperial Officer; nor did he come back of his own head, but by his Majesties express Command, brought to him by the Secretary. And for the Canons which they now produce, we have shewn them to have been the Artifice of Hereticks. The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse Party rais'd a mighty noise, as if they intended to carry the Cause by Clamour and Confusion, till a little silence being made, <hi>Elpidius</hi> mildly address'd himself to the Emperor, <hi>Sir,</hi> (said he) <hi>We will no longer vex and tire your patience, but will put it upon this issue.

The good Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop returned this plain answer, <hi>I have receiv'd this Church from God my Saviour, and am intrusted with the care of this Peoples Souls, and I cannot desert this Charge. But if you be resolved upon it, the Civil Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is yours, throw me out by force, that I may at least plead your Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for the non-performance of my Office.</hi> This somewhat mitigated the rigour that would have been otherwise used, and Officers were sent from Court, who peacibly turn'd him out of the Church, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined him to his own House, intending thereby to try what success their attempts were like to have against him. If they found the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would not bear it, 'twas but bringing him back from his own House to the Church; if they took it quietly, they might then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to further Severities.

And thus things continued till the <hi>Passion-week,</hi> when on the very day of our Lord's Crucifixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he received fresh Orders to leave the Church, whereto he returned such an answer as he thought most convenient.

But the <hi>Magister Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciorum,</hi> who was the chief Officer of the Pallace, refused to meddle, he told them 'twas night, and the Congregation numerous, and that care must be had that nothing should be done rashly. They reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Churches were empty, and that if the Emperor should go thither, and find no body there, he would plainly perceive that the Peoples love to <hi>Chrysostom</hi> had drawn them thence, and would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach them with envy and ill will, who had suggested to him, that there were none that willingly adhered to him.

He went, and came back with this account, that no good was to be done in it, such were the numbers, such the zeal and fervency of the People. Not satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed herewith, they prevailed with him to try once more, and either by fair means reduce the People to the Church, or by force to hinder them from celebrating the Solemnity. And that he might not want fit guides and directors, they lent him some of their Clergy to go along with him, who accompanied him to the place of meeting<note n="o" place="margin">Id. p. <hi>84.</hi> Chrys.

The Villanies committed were inexpressible, and the Confusion infinite, People running up and down all parts of the City, and filling every place they came to with sighs, and groans, and tears, and tragical stories. And Edicts were every where published one upon the back of another, severely threatning all that refused to renounce Communion with <hi>Chrysostom.</hi> As soon as 'twas day the greatest part of the City fled, and betook themselves to Trees or Woods, or Fields, or any places that might but afford a tolerable shelter, where they might keep the Festival. It happened that the Emperor went out that day to divert himself in a Meadow adjoyning to the City, where he espyed a Field covered all over with white. These were the <hi>Catechumens</hi> who had been baptiz'd the night before, and had then (as the Custom was in the Primitive Church) their white Garments upon them, and were in number near three thousand; the dangerous posture of Affairs, and the fears of losing their Bishop having, probably, encreas'd the number of baptismal Candidates at that time. The Emperor was strangely surpriz'd at the sight, and ask'd his Guards who they were; who the more to exasperate him
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:49523:310"/> against them, told him, they were a Conventicle of Hereticks. A Party of Souldiers were immediately drawn out, and ordered to go and disperse the Assembly. Which they did, apprehending some few of the Clergy, but more of the People, whom they put under Custody. Several Women of noble Quality were laid hold on, from some of which they took their Vails, from others their Pendants, plucking away part of the Ear for hast; others to secure themselves from an immodest rudeness and violence, changed Cloaths with their waiting Women, and in that disguise made their escapes. Vast num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers were seized, so that the Prisons were turned into Churches, where Hymns were sung, and the holy Eucharist administred, while Churches were turn'd into Prisons, where nothing was seen or heard but Whips and Scourges, Oaths and Execrations to force the People to renounce and disown their Bishop.</p>

IN this forlorn and hopeless condition of Affairs at home, <hi>Chrysostom</hi> bethought himself of calling in some assistance from abroad, which, if it had no other success, would at least let the World under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the true state of his case, in order whereunto he had some while since resolved upon a dispatch to <hi>Rome,</hi> to make known his case to Pope <hi>Innocent,</hi> and the <hi>Western</hi> Bishops.

And <hi>Eusebius</hi> Deacon of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> who resided at that time at <hi>Rome</hi> as Agent for that Church, came to him, and begg'd of him to suspend his belief of things but a little while, and he should see the whole Scene unra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled and laid open to his view.

                        </note> all the <hi>Palatin</hi>-Officers to abstain from those disorderly and tumultuous Conventicles, (as he calls them) under pain of forfeiting their Places, and confiscation of Estate. But what effect soever this wrought at Court, in the City the <hi>Joannites</hi> still continued their private Meetings, to prevent which he publisht a Law<note n="d" place="margin">Ibid. l. <hi>5.</hi>
                        </note>, commanding all Masters to restrain their Servants from going to those Conventicles, every Master, besides the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Servant, being for each Neglect to pay three Pounds of Gold: and that if the Bankers, or any other of the City-Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:49523:313"/> should be tardy herein, they should for their Members so offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, be fined in a Penalty of Fifty Pounds of Gold. This was dated <hi>September</hi> the xi<seg rend="sup">th</seg>; and that the Countries might fare no better than the City, he directed the following Edict<note n="e" place="margin">Ibid. l. <hi>6.</hi> &amp; Pallad. c. <hi>3.</hi> p. <hi>26.</hi>
                        </note> to <hi>Eutychian</hi> the <hi>Praetorian Praefect,</hi> to be by him transmitted to the Governors of Provinces, to suppress these unlawful Conventicles: <hi>Whosoever does not communicate with</hi> Theophilus, Arsacius, <hi>and</hi> Porphyrius, (who was then newly invested in the See of <hi>Antioch) let him be deposed from his Bishopric; and withal let him forfeit whatever Estate he has either in money or land.</hi> Which being particularly restrain'd to Bishops, was soon after follow'd with another of a more general extent: <hi>Whoever shall conceal a Bishop or a Clergy-man, or so much as entertain in his house any one that communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates with</hi> Chrysostom, <hi>let his house be forfeited, and exposed to Sale.</hi> Nor wanted these Laws a quick and sharp execution, a Tribune being sent with a Party of Soldiers to break up their Meetings, who fell upon them with Clubs and Stones, stripping some, and imprisoning others, which struck such a terror into them, that they durst scarce stir out of their Houses, and many not daring to trust themselves there, betook themselves to a voluntary banishment. And to make their case yet more calamitous, <hi>Optatus</hi> the Governor, under pretence of searching after those that were guilty of the late Fire, exercis'd all manner of severity upon them. Upon this Pretence <hi>Eutropius</hi> the Reader was apprehended, and brought to Trial, where to extort a Confession from him, he was cruelly beaten with Thongs and Clubs, the flesh rak't off his sides and cheeks, with tormenting Irons, and burning Torches put to several parts of his Body, and after all he was sent to Prison, where soon after he died. Nor much better usage did <hi>Tigrius</hi> meet with. He was originally a <hi>Barbarian,</hi> and a Slave, but upon his liberty, which for his faithful and diligent service had been bestowed upon him, was in time advanc'd to be one of the Presbyters of the Church of <hi>Constantinople.</hi> An humble and good man, and admirably courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and charitable to the Poor, to Strangers, whom these merciless Wretches took, stript naked, whipt with Scourges▪ and tying his Hands and Feet, put him upon the Rack, and distended him, till all his parts were out of joint.</p>

So accomplisht a Lady, and then too in the Prime of her Age, could not, we may be sure, want solicitation to a second Marriage; nay, the Emperor <hi>Theodosius</hi> design'd her for a match for his own Kinsman <hi>Elpidius.</hi> The Gentleman follow'd the Suit with an unwearied importunity, but in vain; she plainly told him, If the Emperor had had a mind I should have had an Husband, he would not
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:49523:314"/> have taken him away from me. But knowing me unfit for a married life, and uncapable of pleasing a Husband, he at once freed him from the Prison of the Body, and me from the Yoke of Marriage, and put upon me the gentle and easie yoke of Celibacy. The Emperor was netled with such a stinging Answer, and commanded the Provost of the City to take her whole Estate into his custody, till she should come to be Thirty years of age. The Provost treated her unkindly enough, not giving her liberty so much as to go to Church, or to converse with any Bishop, <hi>Elpidius</hi> urging him to this severity, in hopes that by this means he might bring her to his Bow. But she was so much the more chearful and thankful to God for all her Sufferings, and sent the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror this Message: <hi>You have done, Sir, like a Prince, nay, have carried your Self towards such a poor Wretch as I am, with a care worthy of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, having commanded that heavy charge to be taken care of, the burden whereof lay upon my shoulders. Though you will do a much greater and nobler Service, if you please to give Order that it be distributed to the Poor, and to the necessities of the Church. For I have been long time weary of the applause of such distributions, and have been afraid lest while conversant in these affairs below, I should in the mean time neglect the better and more durable riches of the Soul. Theodosius</hi> could not but admire her vertue, and the gallantry of her Mind, and after his return from his expedition against <hi>Maximus,</hi> commanded her whole Estate to be restor'd to her. And to prevent all such unwelcome addresses for the future, she pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd <hi>Nectarius,</hi> then Bishop, to make her Deaconess of the Church of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where she intirely spent her Time as well as her Estate in Acts of Piety and Charity, seldom departing from the Church day or night. Money or Lands she dispos'd of with a liberal hand, as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion offered; relieved the Poor, made provision for Strangers, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended upon, and ministred to the Bishops, and those that were within the Holy Order. Nay <hi>Theophilus</hi> himself, as much as he afterwards ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and persecuted her for her entertaining the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Monks, did once court her at the highest rate, with the most flattering insinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, while he felt the stream of her beauty flowing towards him. And indeed so great a reputation had her wisdom and vertue given her, that <hi>Nectarius</hi> dispatcht few Ecclesiastick matters without her counsel and advice. But she had a more particular honour and respect for <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> upon whom she personally waited for the most part, super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intending the affairs of his Family, even to the care of his Cloaths, and the provision of his Diet, that it might be such as was agreeable to his weak and languishing stomach. Being thus generally known for so zealous an admirer of the Bishop, and for her almost constant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence about the Church, she was charg'd with having a hand in the late Fire, which the Provost taking for granted, askt her why she had done it? She replied, This has not been the course and manner of my life; no, I have expended the great Estate God gave me in repairing the Church. The Provost told her, He knew very well what had been the manner of her life: If so, said she, take then the Accusers place, and let another sit Judge upon us. Finding nothing to prove the Charge, he fell to another method, representing to them what madness it was to refuse communion with their Bishop, when they might so easily take up, and free themselves from all the troubles that were come upon them. And when some yielded to his promises,
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:49523:314"/>
                        <hi>Olympias</hi> answer'd, <q>It is not just, that I who have there been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly traduc'd and slandered, and judicially convicted of not one of those things whereof I have been accus'd, should yet be forc'd to make my defence for things not laid to my Charge. Grant me therefore this liberty, that I may have Council and Advocates to plead my Cause against the former Charge. For if I should be compell'd, contrary to Law and Right, to communicate with those with whom I ought not, I will never consent to do what no pious and good Christian can warrantably do.</q> The Provost saw no good was to be done upon her, so for that time he dismist her, ordering her to get her Advocates ready. But sending for her not long after, he fined her in a great Sum of Gold, thinking that argument would prevail. But her Mind was got too much above the World, to be sway'd with such considerations, whereupon they proceeded to a Sentence of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, which she readily submitted to, leaving <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and fixing her abode at <hi>Cyzicum,</hi> a City upon the <hi>Hellespont,</hi> whence she was afterwards banish'd to <hi>Nicomedia</hi> in <hi>Bithynia,</hi> and from thence supplied <hi>Chrysostom</hi> with Money and other Necessaries in the time of his Exile. Here she liv'd many years, where after all her sufferings and well-spent Life, she resign'd her pious Soul to God.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. ABOUT this time, if not a little before, <hi>Chrysostom</hi>'s Enemies gain'd another considerable Stickler to their Party. By the death of <hi>Flavian,</hi> the See of <hi>Antioch</hi> became void this year <hi>Ann.</hi> Cccciv. The Person universally desir'd for Successor, was <hi>Constantius</hi>
                        <note n="g" place="margin">Pallad. c. <hi>15.</hi> p. <hi>144.</hi>
                        </note>, Presbyter of that Church, who had been first Secretary, and then Reader and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con; a Man of quick and acute parts, but withall thoughtful and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate; of a most strict and severe life, of a mild, gentle, and quiet temper. There was also at this time Presbyter of the same Church one <hi>Porphyry</hi>
                        <note n="h" place="margin">Id. p. <hi>141, 145,</hi> &amp;c.</note>, who had a long time covered himself with the vail of Hypocrisie, but finding now an opportunity fit for his turn, he threw it off. He was in his private Life a Man of most debauch'd Manners, so given to Wantonness, that he was commonly charg'd with Sodomy, and for the most part kept company with Juglers, and Jesters, and Coach-racers, and such levvd Society, for vvhich his Name vvas more than once upon Record in the Civil Judicatories. He endeavor'd by all subtle and crafty Methods to insinuate himself into Bishops, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates; nay, after he had got vvhat he aim'd at, is said to have melted dovvn the Church-Plate, and given it to the Magistrates, to stand his Friends upon all occasions. The See being novv vacant, he sets up for himself, and his first business vvas to undermine <hi>Constantius.</hi> In order vvhereunto he sent Dispatches to Court, and to all the Bishops that vvere in povver, and so solicited his Cause, that he procured an Edict for <hi>Constantius</hi>'s Banishment to <hi>Oasis,</hi> a desolate part of <hi>Egypt,</hi> vvhich the good Man hearing of, made an Escape, and got to <hi>Cyprus.</hi> Next he imprison'd <hi>Cyriacus</hi> and <hi>Diophantus,</hi> Presbyters, and the rest of the Clergy, whom he knew true to <hi>Constantius.</hi> Then taking the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of the <hi>Olympiack</hi> Games, celebrated every fourth year, and staying till in a manner the whole City was gone out to the <hi>Daphne,</hi> to behold those famous Sports, he, with <hi>Acacius, Severian,</hi> and <hi>Antiochus,</hi> (whom he had privately convey'd thither, and kept there) and some few of the Clergy whom he had gain'd to his Party, went into the Church, and shut the doors close upon them, where they Ordain'd
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:49523:315"/> him, but in such haste and disorder, that they durst not stay to make an end of Prayers. This done, <hi>Severian</hi> and the rest being well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded, fled away by the most private and unfrequented ways. The People returning from the Games, and understanding what had past, were surpriz'd into an astonishment, which held them till the next Morning, when they ran together in a Body to <hi>Porphyry</hi>'s house, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to burn him and his house together, which he suspecting, had betaken himself to <hi>Valentinus</hi> the Commander of the Army, then ready to march against the <hi>Isauri,</hi> whom by Bribes he prevail'd with to stay for his security. With this armed Guard he entred into the Church, where they made havock of what they met with, and tramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Cross under foot. Not long after he sent to Court, where by his Agents he procur'd a peevish, fierce and ill-natur'd old Man to be made Captain of the Night-guards, that so under the shadow of his Authority, he might the more securely prosecute his malicious designs. The People were forc'd to come to Church for fear, and those who could, privately assembled for the discharge of their joint devotions. <hi>Porphyry</hi> in the mean time plagu'd all that favoured <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> and struck in with <hi>Antiochus</hi> and that Party, who followed the Chase with all imaginable Cruelty, especially at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where they found the strongest opposition made against them.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI.

                        </note> subscrib'd by about XXV Bishops, was written to <hi>Rome,</hi> to give them an account of what had past, and was sent by <hi>Theoteonus</hi> Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter of <hi>Constantinople.</hi> Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> could afford them but little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief at that time, (some great Men of the other party throwing rubs in the way) but did what he could, giving <hi>Theotecnus</hi> communicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Letters both to <hi>Chrysostom</hi> himself, and to all the other Bishops that communicated with him. Soon after him came one <hi>Paternus,</hi> who also stil'd himself Presbyter of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> a Fellow of a deformed Aspect, a Look that betray'd the Rancour of his Mind, and the Malice of his Errand, which indeed was to asperse and calumniate <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> bringing along with him Letters from <hi>Acacius, Paulus, Antiochus, Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</hi> and some others, wherein they charg'd the firing of the Church upon him. But they found little welcome, <hi>Innocent</hi> not vouchsafing to answer them. Not many days after arriv'd <hi>Cyriacus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada,</hi> who had fled from <hi>Constantinople,</hi> upon the prosecution of the Edicts against <hi>Chrysostom</hi>'s Followers; and soon after <hi>Eulysius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Apamea</hi> in <hi>Bithynia,</hi> who brought Letters sign'd by 15 Bishops, and among them by <hi>Anysius</hi> the aged Bishop of <hi>Thessalonica,</hi> containing an acount both of the former and later Transactions at <hi>Constantinople.</hi> Within a Month came <hi>Palladius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Hellenople,</hi> who had deserted the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to avoid the Fury of the Edicts; he more particularly acquainted them with the state of things, and shew'd them a Copy of the Edict that had been publish'd last. He was follow'd by <hi>Germanus</hi> a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and <hi>Cassian</hi> a Deacon of <hi>Chrysostom</hi>'s, who brought Letters in the name of all <hi>Chrysostom</hi>'s Clergy, representing the Tyranny that had been practis'd, and the Malice of that potent Faction, by which it had been brought about. And to shew the falshood of the Charge that had been laid upon <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> that he had sold and embezell'd the Church-Plate and Furniture, they produc'd an Inventory of the Plate
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:49523:315"/> both Gold and Silver, and the costly Ornaments which they had under their Custody, and delivered up before <hi>Studius</hi> Provost of the City, <hi>Eutychian</hi> the <hi>Pretorian Praefect, John</hi> Lord Treasurer, <hi>Eustathius</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, and the Clerks and Accomptants belonging to that Office. The next that came was <hi>Demetrius,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Pisynus,</hi> who had travelled up and down the <hi>Eastern</hi> Parts, to let them know that they at <hi>Rome</hi> held communion with <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> shewing <hi>Innocent</hi>'s Letters to that purpose. He brought with him Letters from the Bishops of <hi>Caria,</hi> testifying their communion with <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> and others from the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery of <hi>Antioch,</hi> wherein they declared their agreement with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in this matter, and heavily bewail'd the Usurpation of <hi>Porphyrius,</hi> who had invaded that See. The last that came to <hi>Rome</hi> at this time, and upon this Errand were <hi>Domitian</hi> a Presbyter, and Steward of the Church of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and <hi>Vallagas</hi> a Presbyter of <hi>Nisibis</hi> a City in <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> setting forth the miserable estate of the Monasteries in that Countrey, and bringing with them the Acts and Records of <hi>Optatus</hi> his public Proceedings against the honourable Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> which were Deaconesses of that Church, whom he either forc'd to communicate with <hi>Arsacius,</hi> or fined Two hundred Pounds of Gold to be paid into the Exchequer.</p>

                           <p>ALthough an innocent Person may expect all Prosperity and Success, and ought to seek Mercy and Compassion from God, yet We thought it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Ʋs to write these Letters as Perswasives to Patience, which We have sent by <hi>Cyriacus</hi> the Deacon; lest otherwise the Malice of Enemies should
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:49523:316"/> be more powerful to oppress, than a good Conscience to animate and confirm your hope. For you who are the Pastor and Teacher of so great a Charge, are not to be taught, that in all Ages the best of Men are very often tried, whether they will keep up the strength and vigor of their Patience, or tame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sink under the Evils and Hardships that befall them. And Conscience cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly is the firmest Pillar to support our Minds under all the Miseries and Oppressions that are unjustly laid upon us, which unless we subdue by an invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Patience, we give to others too just suspicion of a bad Cause. That man ought to bear with any thing, that can in the first place repose his trust in God, and in the next securely acquiesce in the satisfaction of his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. A good man may be exercis'd and train'd up to Patience, but he cannot be overcome, having the holy Scriptures at hand as Fortresses to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend and preserve him. For the Divine Lessons which we expound to the People, abound with Examples to this purpose, and set before us almost all the Saints that ever were as subject to manifold Afflictions, and approv'd as 'twere in a School of Trial, before they arriv'd at the Crown and Recompence of their Patience. Let therefore, dear Brother, the Conscience of your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, which under all Calamities is never destitute of the Consolations that naturally slow from Vertue, comfort and stay your Mind; for so long as our great Lord and Master has his Eye upon us, a pure and unspotted Conscience will land us in the Haven of Tranquility and Peace.</p>

But these kind Offices served only in the end to create him so much the more envy and trouble from some, who ought to have been most active and exemplary in kindness to him. <hi>Pharetrius</hi> was at this time Bishop of that See, a man of a timorous and sordid disposition, ready to comply with any Party that was uppermost, and that might save his Stake.

But <hi>Chrysostom</hi> knew the man too well to give any credit to the report, and found things no otherwise than he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected at his coming to <hi>Caesarea.</hi> Where <hi>Phar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>trius</hi> was so far from waiting upon him, or shewing him the least respect, that he set all his Engines on work to hasten his departure thence. The disfavour <hi>Chrysostom</hi> was under at Court, and the displeasure of a powerful Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which all they were liable to that shewed him any kindness, and the envy he conceived at the unusual honours that were done him under his very nose, made him resolve to rid the City of his Company. Indeed <hi>Chrysostom</hi> having recovered some measures of his health, had of himself determined to go onwards with his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, when a sudden accident put a stop to it. For news was brought that the <hi>Isauri</hi> were fallen into these parts with a great Army, and had already burnt a considerable Town, and wasted all places as they came. This created no small alarm at <hi>Caesarea,</hi> every one supposing they would forthwith besiege that place. Whereupon the <hi>Tribune</hi> with what Forces he could on the sudden get together, went out to meet them, leaving the City under such apprehensions of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, that the very aged men were forced to watch and defend the Walls. This for the present stop'd his Journey, and now <hi>Pharetrius</hi> thought he had a fit opportunity to vent his spleen, and having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged the Monks to his Party, made use of them as instruments to effect it, which he managed thus. In the midst of this general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion a Troop of Monks came early in the morning to <hi>Chrys<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Nothing would satisfie, but he must be gone, and when the Magistrates came to interpose, they threatned to cudgel them, and bravingly put them in mind, that this was not the first time they had done so. The Magistrates were startled, and besought <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom</hi> rather to throw himself into the arms of the <hi>Isaurians,</hi> than to expose them to the mercy of these fierce wild Beasts. By this time the Governour of the City had notice of the Riot, who came pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently to the place to assist in his rescue, but they regarded neither his Commands nor Intreaties any more than they had done those of the inferior Magistracy, so that not knowing what to do in the case, he sent to <hi>Pharetrius,</hi> to desire him to take off the Monks, and that by reason of <hi>Chrysostom</hi>'s sickness, and the imminent peril of the War, a few days further respit might be granted him. But neither this way did he prevail, the Monks coming again the next day with more fierceness and violence, and though the Presbyters and the rest of the Clergy had a good mind to help him, and at his first coming had declared their readiness to Communicate with him, and to have nothing to do with his Adversaries, yet durst they not now appear, but like men ashamed hid their heads, when <hi>Chrysostom</hi> sent to speak with them.</p>

NO importunities prevailing, though danger presented it self with an open face, and the very remains of his Feaver were not yet worn off, about noon he went into his Horse-litter, and departed the Town, the People generally flocking after him with cries and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and cursing him that had been the Author of such tragical Proceedings. And when some cried out, whither is it you carry him, into the very Jaws of ruin? Another replyed, go I beseech you, fall among the <hi>Isaurians,</hi> so you leave but us; for into what place so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you shall fall, you may expect to be safe, if once you get but out of our hands. Among the rest of the Company was <hi>Seleucia,</hi> a pious and noble Lady, Wife to <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> and a great honourer of <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom,</hi> who observing the danger he was in, requested him to stay a while and divert himself at a Countrey-house she had five miles out of Town, sending some of her Servants along with him. <hi>Pharetri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> heard of it, and sent her threatning Messages about it, which she generously slighted, and gave order to her Steward to see that no care and diligence should be wanting, and that if the Monks should come thither, and make any disturbance, he should summon the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the neighbouring Villages, and repel them by force. Soon after she intreated him that for his greater security against the attempts of the Bishop and the Monks, he would remove into a Castle of hers hard by, that was fortified against any assault. But this he declined, chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to remain where he was, till <hi>Seleucia</hi> wearied out with <hi>Phare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius</hi>'s threatnings and incessant sollicitations, was unwillingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to part with her Guest, which yet she conceal'd from him, making use of this Stratagem. She caused an Alaram to be rais'd at midnight, that the <hi>Isaurian</hi> Forces were at hand, whereupon <hi>Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thius</hi> his Presbyter went into his Chamber, and hastily awaking him, told him in great amazement, he must rise immediately and be gone, for that the Barbarians were just upon them. The good man was we may imagine, at his wits end, retire back into the City he durst not, to go forwards seemed to run into the mouth of destruction. But as the least of the two evils he chose the latter. So in the midst of a very dark, dismal, and tempestuous night he set out, without any considerable Guides or Guards, for upon the first alarm most of the Company had fled to save themselves. To help what might be in this case, he commanded Torches to be lighted, but these <hi>Euethius</hi> would have put out again, saying, they were the ready way to give direction to the Barbarians where to find them and fall upon them. Thus they pass'd along in a dark night, and a most rugged and stony way, till <hi>Chrysostom</hi>'s Mule stumbling, and throwing him and the Litter to the ground, had like there to have put a period to all his sorrows. But being lifted up, and supported by <hi>Euethius,</hi> he grop'd his way, and crept rather than walk'd along the remainder of the night: In the morning they put themselves into the best posture they could, and proceeded in their Journey. And certainly he had sunk under the burden of so many dangers and hardships, had he not been born up by the Conscience of his innocency, and the goodness of his Cause, and that kind reception he generally met with in his pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, Persons<note n="z" place="margin">

The People were exceeding kind and obliging to him, and readily attended all his occasions, so that he found no want of those many Servants which he had formerly had to wait upon him, nay 'twas a thing they contended for, which should be most officious to him; they guarded his Person against all attempts of danger, and every man was proud to be imployed in that Service. The barrenness of the Soyl did not hinder, but that he was plentifully furnish'd with all necessary Provisions, and happy they that could entertain him. <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oscorus,</hi> a Person of Quality, understanding that he was upon his Journey, sent his man on purpose as far as <hi>Caesarea</hi> to meet him, and desire that he would think of no other Lodgings than at his House.

Nor was <hi>Dioscorus</hi> the only kind Person, several other great men writ to their Stewards and Tenants, commanding them to furnish him with any thing that he stood in need of.

The Climate which he had so much dreaded, agreed well with him, the clearness and purity of the Air, and its temperature at that season adding not a little to his recovery, his health returned apace, and within two days after his arrival he had perfectly worn off all the trouble and weariness of his Journey. The danger of the <hi>Isauri,</hi> whom both he and his Friends were so afraid of, was for that time over: For besides that the Town was well Garrison'd, the <hi>Isauri</hi> were retired upon the approach of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, not likely to return at soonest till the next Summer. These <hi>Isauri</hi> were a hardy People that inhabited the Countrey next Mount <hi>Taurus,</hi> between <hi>Lycaonia</hi> and <hi>Cilicia.</hi> Infamous they were for robbery

And though the <hi>Romans</hi> under the Conduct of P. <hi>Servilius</hi> (who hence deriv'd the Title of <hi>Isauricus</hi>) pretty well scour'd the Countrey, yet they recovered again, and went on still in the same lewd course and manner of Life, being upon all occasions trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some to the Government, and destructive to their Neighbours, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom they made continual inroads, spoiling and plundering whatever came to hand. It was this good man's ill Fortune, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the cruel policy of his Enemies, to be planted near such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate and inhumane Neighbours, though at his first arrival the Coast was clear, and there was no present fear of any sudden ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption to disturb his entertainment. It added not a little to his contentment, to find some of his dearest Friends at this place. The Lady <hi>Sabiniana,</hi> one of his Deaconesses at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> came to <hi>Cucusus</hi> the very same day that he arrived, and though she was of a great age, and unfit for Travel, especially in those rough and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie Countries, yet she conquered all difficulties with a masculine spirit, and the eager desire she had to see and attend <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> and told him further, that she came with an intention to have gone with him into <hi>Scythia,</hi> whither it was confidently reported he was to be sent, and that she had fix'd her Resolution, to await his motions, and never to desert him. <hi>Constantius</hi> also, one of his most intimate Presbyters, having got his leave, was come thither to assist and serve him; not to mention those many Bishops and Presbyters, who came thither to salute, and converse with him. In short, so well was he pleas'd with the conveniencies of this place, that he was afraid he should not be suffered to enjoy them, especially after <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympias</hi> and some others of his Friends began to make an interest at Court, that he might be remov'd to some other place. He desires her therefore not to press this too far; if so much favour might be obtain'd, that it might be left to him to chuse the place of his exile, and when he had done so, be permitted to continue there, or if the design was to transfer him to <hi>Cyzicum,</hi> or some Port town, or any place about <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> she should thankfully accept the grant; but if she perceived they intended to remove him to a place of the same, or a remoter distance, she should immediately obstruct it. He liv'd here in some tolerable ease and quiet, and was surrounded with the kindness and company of his Friends, and was fearful he might be design'd for some more remote and desolate place, and dreaded the trouble and hardships of a Journey (which he had so lately smarted under, and which had brought him even to deaths door) worse than a thousand banishments.</p>

To prevent the severity of these Laws, some that were Rich complied to save their Estates, others that were Poor, or that saw not far into the state of things, were by large promises drawn into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him. But the far greatest part stood off, and preferr'd the goodness of their Cause before Riches or Honour, Kindred, or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and chose rather to flie to the Mountains, or to hide themselves in the remotest Monasteries, or to betake themselves into Foreign Parts; and those that did stay, were forc'd to assemble in the Fields, and to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer up their Devotions under the open Canopy of Heaven.</p>

                           <p>This is the third time that I have written to your Clemency, request<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Proceedings which by a malicious Combination have been carried on against <hi>John</hi> Bishop of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> might be rectified: which it seems is not yet done. Wherefore being greatly solicitous about the peace of the Church, whereby our Empire is preserv'd quiet and peaceable, I have once more written by these Bishops and Presbyters, that you would please to order the Bishops of the <hi>East</hi> to meet at <hi>Thessalonica.</hi> In order whereunto our <hi>Western</hi> Bishops have made choice of persons of unbiast Truth and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, five Bishops, two Presbyters, and one Deacon of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, to come upon this Errand, whom I desire you to receive with all Honour and Respect; that if they be satisfied that <hi>John</hi> was duly and justly depos'd, I also upon their information may withdraw from Communion with him: or if they can convince the <hi>Eastern</hi> Bishops, that they have been knowingly guilty of evil Practices in this matter, they may prevail with you to desert
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:49523:322"/> their Communion. What opinion the <hi>Western</hi> Bishops have concerning <hi>John,</hi> is evident from all the Epistles that have been sent me, whereof I have annext two, of the same importance with the rest, one from the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> the other from him of <hi>Aquileia.</hi> But above all things I beseech you to take care, that <hi>Theophilus</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> who is reported to be the chief Author of all these mischiefs, may whether he will or no be forc'd to appear, that so the Council meeting with no Obstruction, may establish such a Peace, as may become the tranquility of our Reign.</p>

                        </note>, together with others from <hi>Innocent, Chromatius</hi> of <hi>Aquileia, Venerius</hi> of <hi>Milan,</hi> and the rest, were delivered to <hi>Aemilius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Beneventum, Cythegius,</hi> and <hi>Gaudentius</hi> Bishops, and to <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinian</hi> and <hi>Boniface</hi> Presbyters, with whom went <hi>Cyriacus, Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius, Palladius,</hi> and <hi>Eulysius,</hi> all <hi>Eastern</hi> Bishops. They received like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise a <hi>Memorial</hi> from the Synod, which was to this effect; That <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom</hi> should not be admitted to sit in Council, till he was restor'd to Communion, and the possession of his See, that so all pretence of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny being remov'd, he might of his own accord come in, and take his place. Thus furnish'd with authority and instructions, they set forwards at the Public Charge in their Journey to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> but the Malice of their Enemies was too quick for them; for as they past by <hi>Athens,</hi> they were detain'd by the <hi>Tribune</hi> that commanded in those Parts, who sent a Centurion with them, but would not suffer them to go to <hi>Thessalonica,</hi> where they intended to deliver their Letter to <hi>Any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi> Bishop of the place. He divided their Company, and put them aboard two small Vessels, and after a very tempestuous Passage, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they ate nothing for three days, on the third day about Noon they came before <hi>Constantinople,</hi> at a place near <hi>Victor</hi>'s Countrey-house. Here they were stopt by the Officers of the Custom-house, who forc'd them back, and sent them Prisoners to <hi>Athyra,</hi> a Castle on the Coast of <hi>Thrace,</hi> where they were kept asunder, the <hi>Italians</hi> in an Apartment by themselves, and <hi>Cyriacus</hi> and his Company separated from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that with so much strictness, that they were not permitted to have a Servant to attend them. Next, their Letters were demanded, which they refus'd to part with, saying, How can we that are Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors, deliver the Emperors, and the Bishops Letters, to any other but the Emperor? <hi>Patricius</hi> the Secretary, and several others, were sent upon this Errand, but to no purpose, till at length came <hi>Valerian,</hi> a stur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Cappadocian,</hi> a Military Commander, who rudely pressing upon them, broke the Thumb of <hi>Marianus,</hi> one of the Bishops then present, in the Scuffle, and took away the Letters by force from them. The next day came Messengers from Court, or at least from <hi>Atticus,</hi> who brought them three thousand pieces of Mony, persuading them to communicate with <hi>Atticus,</hi> and not to mention the proceedings about <hi>Chrysostom.</hi> But they rejected the Motion, and finding by their barbarous treatment, that they were like to do little good, desir'd, that since they could do nothing in order to Peace, they might at least be suffered safely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home. While they continued here, <hi>Chrysostom</hi> wrote no less than three several Letters<note n="t" place="margin">

And to
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:49523:322"/> the very same purpose, and the same manner of Epistles<note n="u" place="margin">
                           <hi>Ep.</hi> Clxv, Clxvi, Clxvil, <hi>p.</hi> 902, <hi>&amp;c. vid. Ep.</hi> Cxlviii. <hi>p.</hi> 891.</note>, he wrote to the Bishops that came along with them, that is, to <hi>Cyriacus</hi> and his Collegues. At length, when no Arts could prevail upon them, and they still persisted in their desires to be gone, <hi>Valerian</hi> was sent to them, who clapt them aboard a rotten Ship, with twenty Soldiers drawn out of several Regiments, and as the report went, agreed with the Master of the Ship to cast the Bishops away in the Voyage. Having sail'd a great way, they were upon the very brink of ruine, when they arriv'd at <hi>Lampsacus,</hi> where they chang'd their Ship, and on the twentieth day after their setting out, reacht <hi>Hydruns,</hi> a City in <hi>Calabria,</hi> whence they got to <hi>Rome,</hi> and four Months after their first setting out, ended their fruitless and unfortunate Embassy, not being able so much as to give an account, where, or in what condition <hi>Chrysostom</hi> was. As for <hi>Cyriacus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Emesa, Demetrius, Palladius,</hi> and <hi>Eulysius,</hi> the Companions both of their Voyage and their Sufferings, and whom they left behind them in Prison at <hi>Athyra,</hi> they were soon after sent into Banishment, <hi>Cyriacus</hi> to <hi>Palmyra</hi> in <hi>Persia,</hi> and the rest to other places, as we have before related.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. THE dangers to which <hi>Chrysostom</hi> was continually expos'd at <hi>Cucusus,</hi> (where he had now sojourn'd a full year) made him suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently weary of that place. The following Winter he spent in shift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up and down from place to place, as they could administer to his shelter and safety, the Woods and the Rocks, next to God's Providence, being his best security. And here I cannot but mention the Relation of a Modern Traveller<note n="w" place="margin">J. B. Tavern, Travels. Part I. c. <hi>2.</hi> p. <hi>6.</hi>
                        </note>, who describing his Journey through those Parts, tells us, They came to <hi>Charliqueu</hi> a famous Town in <hi>Armenia,</hi> about two Miles from which, in the midst of a Plain, arises a vast Rock, upon the North-side whereof you ascend about nine or ten steps into a Chamber, with a Bed, a Table, and a Cupboard in it, all hewen out of the Rock. Upon the West-side, you ascend other five or six steps that lead to a little Gallery about five or six foot long, and three broad, cut also out of the Rock, though of extraordinary hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. The Tradition of the Christians of that place affirms, that S. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> made this Rock his retiring place, where they shew you the print of a Man's Body. Upon which account the <hi>Caravans</hi> of Christian Merchants pay their Devotions at this Rock, the Bishop of the place, attended by some Priests, who have every one a Taper in his hand, going and saying Prayers. But I return: The holy Man having shifted for himself as well as he could in the Parts about <hi>Cucusus,</hi> he was remov'd to <hi>Arabissus</hi>
                        <note n="x" place="margin">
                           <hi>Epist.</hi> Lxvli. <hi>p.</hi> 821. Cxxxi. <hi>p.</hi> 877. <hi>Pallad. c.</hi> 10. <hi>p.</hi> 96.</note>, a City also of the <hi>Lesser Armenia,</hi> as a place of greater safety against the <hi>Isaurian</hi> Inroads. But though he chang'd the Stage, the Scene continued much-what the same. The barbarous People still forrag'd the Countrey, and came up hither, who forc'd him to quit the Town, and retire for Sanctuary into the Castle, which yet prov'd more sad and dismal than a Prison. <hi>Without were fightings, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were fears;</hi> without nothing but Danger threatned them at the Gates, and the dreadful Prospect of a wasted, burnt, and desolated Country was round about them; within Famin began to rage, caus'd by the straitness of the place, and the multitudes of People that had fled thither. And yet his own case still much worse: for besides his share in the common Calamity, he labour'd under a long and dangerous sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which the late hard Winter, and his being forc'd to seek pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:49523:323"/> from Woods and Caverns, had brought upon him; and all this aggravated with the want of his Friends, whom the infested Roads, and the dangers of the Passage would not suffer to come at him. In these Parts he continued all the Summer, and the greatest part, I guess, if not the whole, of the following Winter, taking all opportunities of preaching about the neighbouring Countrey, and reducing the rude and untaught People both to Civility and Religion. Towards the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of his stay here, he wrote a Letter<note n="y" place="margin">Ext. Tom. <hi>4.</hi> p. <hi>683.</hi>
                        </note> to Pope <hi>Innocent,</hi> which being very elegant, (could it be rendred agreeable to its native Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage) and one of the last that ever he wrote, we shall here insert.</p>

But since the solitariness of this place denies us that happiness, (for not only those that come from you, but not so much as those that dwell in these Parts can come at us, both because we are shut up in a most blind and remote corner of the World, and because Thieves and Robbers every where way-lay and infest the passages) we beg, that our long continued silence may rather move your Pity, than provoke you to charge us with Neglect. For be assur'd 'tis no Contempt has made us so, and therefore laying hold of an opportunity we have long waited for, the Journey of the Reverend and Beloved Presbyter, <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> the Deacon, we have writ to you, and think we cannot thank you enough for that kindness and compassion you have shew'd us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the tenderest bowels of a Father. For what in you lies, you have taken care, that all things be duly reform'd and rectified, all scandals and disorders remov'd, the Churches setled in Peace, and a pleasant serenity, that all things run in a proper Channel, and neither the Laws be subjected to contempt or force, nor the Constitutions of the ancient Fathers violated. But there are those that have hindred these designs from taking any effect, and not content with what they have done heretofore, by their late attempts they have out-done the Villany of their former Practices. I shall not venture to set them down, the particular account whereof would exceed the limits not of an Epistle only, but an History. But although they have so entangled and confounded all things, that they seem incurably disordered, and uncapable of a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:49523:323"/> yet I beseech you still endeavour to reclaim them, and not give the affair over in despair, considering of what mighty importance it would be to bring it to an happy issue, and indeed in some measure the whole world is interested and concerned in this matter. The Churches are wasted and brought low, the People dispersed, the Clergy subdued and trampled on, the Bishops banisht, and the Ecclesiastick Canons trodden down. Once therefore and again, yea and again I beseech you to use your utmost care and diligence, and the greater the storm is, let your study and endeavour be so much the more. For I have yet some hope, that things may be brought to some good success. But if not, the merciful God will however prepare a Crown for the reward of your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and the suffering Parties will receive no small comfort from the abundance of your charity. I am now in the third year of my Banishment, expos'd to Famine, Pestilence, War, continual Sieges, to an incredible soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and desolation, to death every day, and to the points of the <hi>Isaurian</hi> Swords. In the midst of all which Evils, 'tis no little support and comfort, that we have an interest in your constant and immutable affection, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of addressing to you, and that we are refresht so much by your ready and sincere Charity. This is our Fortress, this our Security, this our calm and quiet Haven, this the treasury of a thousand good things, this is our rejoicing, and the spring of infinite pleasure and delight. And if after all, we should be driven into a more desolate corner, then that wherein we now are, 'tis this would make us depart with a mighty consolation under all our Sufferings.</p>

To this end <hi>Severian</hi> of <hi>Gabala, Porphyry</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and others of that Party, by their Friends at Court procur'd an Order from the Emperor, commanding under Penalty, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay he should be remov'd to <hi>Pityus,</hi> the more barren and desolate place of the whole Region of <hi>Tzana,</hi> and situate upon the very shore of the <hi>Pontic</hi> Sea. The <hi>Praetorian</hi> Soldiers appointed for his Guard, us'd him by the way with more than ordinary ruggedness and severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, saying, They had Orders so to do, plainly declaring, That if they could weary him out of his Life in the Journey, they expected prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for their pains. One indeed had more regard to common huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, than his own interest, and privately did him all the kind offices he could. But what Cruelty was wanting in him, there was another made up, a Man of so ill a Nature, that when Addresses were made to him by the way to be kind to the holy Bishop, he took them as so many
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:49523:324"/> Injuries offer'd to himself, his main business being to hasten him to an untimely End. When it rain'd with the greatest violence, he would go on, though himself was wet to the very skin; 'twas a pleasure to him to travel in the extreme heat of the day, because he knew how much it would afflict the good Man. When they came to any Town where there was the conveniency of a Bath for his refreshment, he would not suffer him to stay a minute. In this troublesom way of journying, (more cruel to him than death, and by which his body was tann'd, like an Apple redded in the Sun, as my Author expresses it) they had now spent a considerable time, and were come to <hi>Comana Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica,</hi> (not the <hi>Comana</hi> in <hi>Armenia,</hi> as <hi>Sozomen</hi> by Mistake makes it) a City of <hi>Cappadocia</hi> at the foot of the <hi>Antitaurus,</hi> where they would not suffer him to lodge, but carried him to a place five or six Miles off, the <hi>Martyrium</hi> or Oratory of S. <hi>Basiliscus,</hi> who had been sometime Bishop of <hi>Comana,</hi> and in the Persecution under <hi>Maximian,</hi> suffer'd Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom at <hi>Nicomedia</hi> in <hi>Bithynia.</hi> We are told that in the Night the Martyr appear'd to him, and said, <hi>Be of good comfort, Brother, for to morrow we shall be together;</hi> and that he had foretold his arrival to the Presbyter that attended that place, and had bid him provide a place for our Brother <hi>John,</hi> for he is coming. In confidence of, and compliance with the warning he had receiv'd, <hi>Chrysostom</hi> the next day requested of his Guard, that he might stay there till eleven of the clock, which they churlishly denied, and hurried him out. But they had not gone four Miles, when finding him extremely ill, they brought him back to the Oratory. When he was come in, he call'd for white Cloaths, which he put on fasting, having stript himself from head to foot, and bestow'd those he put off upon them that attended him. Then he receiv'd the holy Eucharist, and before them all made his last Prayer, and having concluded with his usual Doxology, <hi>Glory be to God for all things that happen,</hi> and seal'd up all with his last <hi>Amen,</hi> he stretch'd out himself, and gently resign'd up his Soul to Christ. It hapned that there was at this time thereabouts a mighty confluence of Monks, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Virgins, and other pious persons from <hi>Syria, Cilicia, Pontus,</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia,</hi> as if they had been purposely summon'd thither, all which were great Mourners at his Funeral.

                     <p n="1">I. HE was in his outward shape (if we may credit the descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the <hi>Greek Menologies</hi> give of him) low of stature, his Head big, but bald (whence <hi>Palladius</hi> says<note n="c" place="margin">

                        </gap>, a <hi>bald-pate</hi> like <hi>Elisha</hi>) his forehead large, but full of wrinkles, his eyes sunk deep inwards, but withal quick and amiable, his Cheeks lank and hollow, his Beard short and thin. 'Twas the look of a man truly mortified to the World, one that by the admirable strictness of his life, had subdued the Flesh to the Spirit, and had brought the appetites of Sence in subjection to the Laws of Reason. He was naturally inclin'd to Choler, which as it was greatly increas'd by an over-rigorous abstinence, so it infus'd a more than ordinary briskness and activity into his temper, and made him fearlesly attempt, and resolutely go on with any undertaking, wherein his Duty or the interest of Religion was concern'd. His Zeal for God always transported him beyond all considerations of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency or danger, he was himself true to the rules of piety, and he endeavoured to make others so. The truth and honour of the Christian Religion he strenuously defended against the attempts of <hi>Gentiles</hi> on the one hand, and Hereticks on the other. He wrote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, and where Arguments would not do, implor'd the help of the civil Authority to assist in it. He was startled to find that in that broad daylight of Christianity, <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> a neighbouring Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, was still overspread with the darkness of Paganism and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: For the Conversion whereof he form'd a society of zealous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, whom he prevail'd with to undertake it, and procur'd Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Edicts to back them, and by his own, and the Charity of others furnish'd out a Stock to carry it on, and when the work not only stood still, but went backwards, he ceas'd not even in the time of his exile to reinforce it, and make provision for the Charges of it.
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:49523:325"/> He frequently silenc'd the Blasphemies, and suppress'd the insolences of the <hi>Arians, Anomaeans, Marcionites,</hi> and other home-enemies to the Faith, and us'd all kindly and probable methods to reduce them from the errors of their ways.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. THE Affairs of his Episcopal Cure he follow'd with all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable sollicitude and fidelity, he constantly attended publick Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, preach'd frequently, and some parts of the year, especially in <hi>Lent,</hi> every day. And when at any time detain'd by sickness<note n="d" place="margin">Vid. Phot. Cod. CLXXII. col. <hi>385.</hi> Vid. Chrys. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil. <hi>1.</hi> de div. loc. N. T.

                        </note>, was wont to account this forc'd silence, and absence from his People, worse than the Disease it self. And no sooner was he restor'd to any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of strength, but he return'd to the Pulpit with a kind of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph and rejoycing, declaring he look'd upon this opportunity of conversing with his beloved Auditory as the sweetest accent of his health, and was as much affected and delighted with it, as men are wont to be, that after a tedious absence, and a long Journey are come home safe. The irregularities of his Clergy, grown more loose through the incircumspection of a mild and easie Predecessor, he corrected sharply, and though it created him no little envy and opposition, he went thorow with it, suspending and discharging those, whom perswasion and admonition would not reclaim. His Reproofs were severe and impartial, he neither fear'd or spar'd the greatest, nor despis'd and overlook'd the meanest. His generous mind was too big to be aw'd from the discharge of his duty, in this no Interest could oblige him, from this no terrors or threatnings could affright him, where-ever he espied a real and material fault, he let sly at it, and if private admonition would do no good, they were sure to hear of it in publick, and that many times with tart reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the chief occasions that engag'd the Empress, and the great Ministers at Court in so fierce and violent a Persecution of him. Sometimes he would set himself to jear<note n="e" place="margin">Pallad. c. <hi>19.</hi> p. <hi>187.</hi>

And though he stood as fair as any man to be the darling both of Court, City, and Countrey, and a little courtliness and complyance in his temper might have rendred him perhaps one of the greatest Favourites of his age, yet would he not take one step out of his way to gain the highest honours or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests, no not to secure his Bishoprick, nor to save his Life.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. His Charity kept pace with, if not rather exceeded his other Vertues. His own Estate, which was very considerable, he parted with in his younger days to the uses of the Poor, and the exigences of the Church at <hi>Antioch,</hi> and when advanc'd to the See of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi>

Which proceeded not from the vicious niceness of his palate, but the incurable infirmity of his stomach. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> when engag'd hard at his studies, or wrapt up in Divine Contemplation, or taken up with Ecclesiastic Affairs, he would many times lapse the usual times of dining, and eat nothing till the evening: which were the true causes, why he chose to eat alone. The truth is, his whole Life was in effect a continued Fast, he having from his younger years so accustomed himself to the utmost severities of Abstinence and Mortification, that he had irreparably wasted his stomach, and rendred it almost irreconcileable to any ordinary food, and so far weakned nature, that no Arts of Physic were able to retrieve his health, having thereby laid the foundation of those frequent infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and distempers, that haunted him to his dying day.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. NATURE had enrich'd him with very exquisite Abilities and Endowments, a clear Apprehension, prompt Wit, acute Reasoning, pregnant Invention, and all these attended with a nimble and ready utterance, and an apt way of expressing his Conceptions. Notions flow'd quick into his imagination, and found words ready to cloath and dress them up in their proper shapes; as will be very evident to any that shall peruse his <hi>Extempore</hi>-Orations, where there could be no place for Premeditation. His Juvenile Education under the best Masters of that Age, had laid in a sufficient stock of Learning and Philosophy, though he had not occasion to make much use of it. For after he had a very little time serv'd the <hi>Forum,</hi> he went early over to the study of Theology, to which he applied himself under the conduct of <hi>Miletius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Antioch, Eusebius</hi> and <hi>Diodorus,</hi> who govern'd the Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in those Parts, and were both Bishops afterwards. He set himself with all possible seriousness and industry to read and understand the holy Scriptures, which he afterwards so largely and accurately explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and above all peculiarly studied S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epistles, which he seldom laid out of his hand: and indeed there seems to have been a more peculiar conformity of <hi>genius</hi> and temper between that great Apostle, and this excellent Prelate. Having thus ransack'd the Sacred Treasuries, and carried away a noble Furniture of Divine Learning, he gave up himself almost intirely to preaching and instructing others. A Province he manag'd, with that clearness and perspicuity, that force and evidence, that freedom and smartness, and yet with that temper and sweetness, that in the whole Train of ancient Fathers none
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:49523:326"/> went beyond him, and few came near him. The Scriptures he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded very naturally, and in the obvious and literal sense; a happy Talent almost peculiar to him, the main humor of those Ages being to wire-draw Scripture into Allegories, and to make witty Allusions, and pick out mystical and far-fetch'd Expositions, which were never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and when found out, serv'd to little or no use or purpose. In all his Expository Homilies he takes the plain sense that naturally of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers it self, which he opens, and illustrates with some short and pithy Remarks and then (which is his Application) concludes with a <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, some general Exhortation, not always adapted to his preceding discourse, but prosecuted upon some moral argument of great advantage to his Auditory. And indeed so happy a Talent had he in expounding Scripture, that an ancient Writer<note n="m" place="margin">

                        </note> assures us, That his judgment here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was accounted the common standard of the Church, insomuch that although all the rest of the Fathers unanimously concurr'd in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of any one place, yet if his sense differ'd from it, his Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was immediately chosen, and preferr'd before, yea, against all the rest. And this he tells us had been, and still was the custom and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Church in his time. He reproves Vice with great impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, and with severe Censures, and yet conveys his Reproofs with that sweetness and tenderness, those soft and elegant insinuations, that they made their way without any difficulty into the Minds of his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and the most obstinate Offenders could not but love and kiss the hand that chastis'd them, his discourses at once administring both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and delight. Though Master of a great deal of secular Learning, he makes no ostentation of it; but though it be not ordinarily discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, yet it gave his discourses a better relish, like generous Wine mixt with water, (as <hi>Erasmus</hi> wittily represents it) where though the taste and colour of the water cannot be distinguisht, yet it makes the Wine drink more pleasant and delightful. It adds not a little to the reputation of his Learning, that he bred such a Race of excellent Men, who were his Scholars, Men famous both for the contemplative and practical Philosophy of Christianity: such were <hi>Palladius</hi> Bishop of <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

THE vein of Oratory, which he learnt in the School of <hi>Liba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> he brought with him into the Church; where he employ'd it to the use of the present, and the admiration of all future Ages. His style is clear, chaste, easie, and elegant; his conceptions slow in the most apt, familiar, and intelligible expressions, though whenever his Argument requir'd it, or his Leisure permitted it, he could cloath his Mind with a more accurate Eloquence, witness his elaborate composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions while he was at <hi>Antioch,</hi> where he enjoy'd ease, and more calm and retired thoughts, than he did afterwards.

The Emperor told him, He saw no great inconvenience, if for peace and quietness sake a dead Man's name was put into the Catalogue; so he did it accordingly. An account whereof he sent in a Letter to <hi>Cyril,</hi> who had lately succeeded his Uncle <hi>Theophilus</hi> in the See of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> wherein he laid before him a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of what had past in this matter, and the reason that had induc'd him to it, having inserted his Name not as one that died a Bishop, but as one that sometimes had been so, and whose Name challeng'd a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration in order to Peace and Unity, assuring him, he had done nothing herein contrary to the Ecclesiastic Canons, and desiring him for Uniformity to take order that it should be so done through all the Churches in <hi>Egypt.</hi> He wrote<note n="k" place="margin">Ext. Epist. ap. Niceph. ib. p. <hi>493.</hi>
                        </note> likewise at the same time to <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Aedesius,</hi> Deacons of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> who had been lately resident at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> and knew what had past, and were able to give a satisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry account of it, whose prudent management of things he lik'd so well beyond those who had been sent in their room, that he requested to hasten their return thither. But <hi>Cyril,</hi> by means of his education un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Theophilus,</hi> had drunk in too deep a prejudice against <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> to be easily reconcil'd to this affair, and besides thought the credit of his Uncle highly concern'd in it. He wrote therefore a large and sharp Answer<note n="l" place="margin">Ext. ib. c. <hi>27.</hi> p. <hi>494.</hi>
                        </note> to <hi>Atticus,</hi>
                        <q>wherein he remonstrated the great imprudence and inconvenience of what had been done; that whatever might be pretended, he was certainly inform'd, that he had inserted <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom</hi>'s Name not in the Lay, but Episcopal part of the <hi>Diptychs;</hi> and had violated the honor and authority of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to which the other had been depos'd, and was fallen from his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopal place and station, and could not be restor'd without a mighty injury to all Bishops in the world, who must needs reckon themselves
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:49523:329"/> affronted by it, and it became a wise and good man to prevent such inconveniencies; that he had gain'd little or nothing by it, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and best part of the Church were his already, and herein he only oblig'd to his prejudice a perverse inconsiderable Party, who would never take the just measures of themselves: now whom was it most reasonable to gratifie in this matter, the best and greatest, or the worst and smallest number? If therefore he would preserve peace, and do right, he must undo what he had done, and strike the Name out of the Episcopal Roll; and however this might displease a few, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perverse and obstinate, they were better lost than kept, to level the Episcopal with the Laical Dignity, being the ready way not to establish Union, but to introduce Confusion into the Church: that though some of the <hi>Eastern</hi> Bishops might have been impos'd on by <hi>Alexander</hi>'s confident persuasion, yet that was a fault that needed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and he should rather imitate <hi>Theodotus,</hi> who was troubled at the force that had been used to him in this case, and begg'd advice which way he might be freed from it. It seem'd strange to him, that when <hi>Alexander</hi> with all his Eloquence could prevail with but a few, that one obscure Messenger should be able to blow up a whole Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude at once, and that in a Cause so long laid asleep. That he said all this, not to triumph over a dead Man, or that he took pleasure in the evils that befel another, but his compassion was to be over-rul'd for the good of the Church, whose Canons he held in the first place of esteem and value; and since these two Cases could not stand together, the Ecclesiastic Constitutions should take place, and he who was no Bishop, should be thrown out of the Episcopal <hi>Diptychs.</hi> This was the way to unite the Church, to settle Concord and Unanimity, and for all others to preserve a pure and unspotted communion with him; that therefore he should not value a single Man, and adhere to such a person, before so many yet alive, and especially before his submission to the Rules and Constitutions of the Church.</q>

                     <p n="4">IV. WHAT <hi>Atticus</hi> thought of this Letter, does not appear. 'Tis plain what a mighty prejudice <hi>Cyril</hi> had conceiv'd against the Memory of this good Man; nay, by some he is said to have proceeded so far, as to burn and destroy <hi>Chrysostom</hi>'s Writings. But these Heats held not long. <hi>Cyril</hi>

                        </note> though a man of like passions with others, was yet of an honest mind. Several dealt with him about this Controversie, but none more effectually than <hi>Isidore</hi> the <hi>Pelusiot,</hi> who plied him sometimes with powerful Arguments, sometimes with Reproofs and Admonitions, till he gave up the Cause. We are told moreover, that he had a Dream or Vision, wherein <hi>Chrysostom</hi> attended with a celestial Guard, and glorious Retinue, seem'd to drive him out of the Church, while the Blessed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin importun'd <hi>Chrysostom</hi> that he might continue there. But this, no doubt, was the addition of After-ages, when Superstition began to govern all. However <hi>Cyril</hi> repented of his rash and imprudent zeal against <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> and was heartily reconcil'd to his memory. To which end he summon'd a Provincial Synod, by whose authority <hi>Chrysostom</hi>'s name was unanimously restor'd to the <hi>Diptychs,</hi> whose example herein was follow'd by the Prelates of all the greater Churches, and his Name after this Cloud brake out with a far brighter Lustre.</p>

The Body they first landed at S. <hi>Thomas</hi> his Church, then remov'd it to that of S. <hi>Irene,</hi> whence attended with an infinite throng, and all possible demonstrations of Pomp and Honour, it was in the Emperor's own Chariot carried to the place of its Repose, the Church of the <hi>Apostles.</hi> Here the good Emperor, accompanied by his Virgin Sisters, Persons of admirable strictness and devotion came to the Corps, and covering the Coffin with his Imperial Cloak, put his Eyes and Forehead to it, and heavily bewail'd the wrong that his Parents had done the Holy Man. The Divine Offices being compleated, they proceeded to his Interrment at the Foot of the Communion-Table, the Bishops then present helping him into the Grave with their own hands.

Forc'd to write <hi>Adversus Gentes,</hi> to give satisfaction of the truth of his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. His great joy for his being rescued from Gentilism. His Learning. Abatements to be made for his want of skill in Christian Theology. His style, method, and way of Writing. The Commentaries upon the <hi>Psalms</hi> under his name, whose.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT <hi>Arnobius</hi> was by birth an <hi>African,</hi> there can be no cause to doubt, especially when, as they said of S. <hi>Peter, his speech agreeth thereto.</hi> He was educated in all the <hi>Gentile</hi> Learning of that Age, wherein he became so great a Master, that in the Reign of <hi>Diocletian</hi> he open'd a School of <hi>Rhetoric</hi>

                     </note> at <hi>Sicca,</hi> an Inland Town in <hi>Afric,</hi> and a <hi>Roman</hi> Colony. Here as he wanted no Scholars, so he taught with great Fame and Reputation. He was a fierce <hi>Bigot</hi> for Paganism, which he maintain'd with all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of his Wit and Parts. And thus he continued 'till the <hi>Diocletian</hi> Persecution, which brake out <hi>Ann. Chr.</hi> CCCIII. when the great severity which he saw used towards the innocent Christians, and their incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49523:336"/> patience, meekness, and constancy under their heaviest Sufferings, awaken'd his mind to a more serious and impartial enquiry into things. And as Heaven is never wanting to the honest designs of Men, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially where they are like to be more than ordinarily useful to the Church, he was often warn'd by divine Admonitions in his Dreams to turn Christian. This he now resolv'd upon, and accordingly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented himself to the Bishop of the place in order to it. But the Flock is naturally afraid of the Wolf. The Christians at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> were not at first more shy of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> than the Bishop of <hi>Sicca</hi> and the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians were of <hi>Arnobius,</hi> not imagining that so hot a Zeal for Paganism should cool all on a sudden, but rather suspected 'twas but a trick to trapan and circumvent them, especially in those times, and therefore refus'd to admit him, 'till he had given some signal Evidence of the reality of his Conversion. Hereupon he set himself to vindicate the cause of Christianity against the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> which he did in seven Books, wherein he vigorously asserted the truth and excellency of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion, and so wittily expos'd the follies of Pagan Worship, so shamefully baffled all their specious and popular Insinuations, that a Man might wonder with what con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                     </note> 'twas then about three hundred years more or less since Christianity first set out into the World. By this uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulable Demonstration he remov'd all possibility of jealousie and suspicion, and was joyfully entertain'd, and receiv'd to Baptism.

                     </note> and adorn'd with Temples, Palaces, Circusses, Magazines, Courts of Justice, and all manner of stately and magnificent Buildings, resolving to make it equal to <hi>Rome</hi> it self; and if he espied the least fault in any Structure, when finish'd, he immediately caus'd it to be pull'd down again, and set up anew, to the utter ruine and undoing of the Country, the Rich in their Purses, and the Poor in their Persons. And what was yet worse, where-ever he espied a convenient piece of Ground, or a more elegant Building fit for his turn, he was not content barely to take it away, but the Owner must be arraign'd, and executed for Treason, that so it might escheat to the Crown, under a pretence of Justice. By this means he render'd that City very splendid and magnificent. And because Learning has been ever accounted the chief Glory of any place, his next care was to furnish it with the most eminent Professors. Among whom, <hi>Lactantius</hi> is pitch'd on, and sent<note n="h" place="margin">Hieron. ubi supr.</note> for out of <hi>Afric</hi> to profess <hi>Rhetoric</hi> at <hi>Nicomedia.</hi> At his arrival there, he betook himself to his Professors place; but <hi>Latin</hi> Eloquence found little entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: For <hi>Greek</hi> being the common Language of that place, he had few Scholars, so that in a short time he was forc'd to shut up his School, and betook himself to writing Books. His first essay was an <hi>Hodoeporicon</hi> in Heroic Verse, wherein he describ'd his Voyage from <hi>Afric</hi> to <hi>Nicomedia;</hi> and next, a Book which he call'd <hi>Grammaticus.</hi> After this, he set upon his Book <hi>De Opificio Dei,</hi>
                     <note n="i" place="margin">Vid. Institut. l. <hi>2</hi> c. <hi>10.</hi> p. <hi>199.</hi>
                     </note> wherein, from the admirable creation and composition of Men, he elegantly argues a Divine Providence, and that both from the frame of his Body, and the nature of his Soul. This he dedicated to <hi>Demetrian,</hi> (as he did also two Books of Epistles) who had been his Scholar, whom he tells in the close,<note n="k" place="margin">De Opific. Dei. c. <hi>20.</hi> p. <hi>892.</hi>
                     </note> that he intended hereafter to discourse these matters more at large, especially what concern'd the state of another Life, and partly from the Principles of his own Religion, partly from their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement among themselves, would shew that the Philosophers were quite out of the way, who, notwithstanding all their plausible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, were the greatest Enemies to Truth: And that for his own part, he desired to live for no other end, than to compose what might be useful to Humane Life; and he should then think he had liv'd long enough, and to purposes good enough, when what he writ might serve to recover any from Error, and to set them in the right way to Heaven. And indeed it was not long before he was engag'd in the Defence of Christianity against the attempts of the <hi>Gentile</hi>-Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, tho God knows upon too sad an occasion, I mean the fierce Persecution rais'd by <hi>Diocletian.</hi> The first springs and motions where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of being particularly discover'd by no other Author but <hi>Lactantius,</hi> who was then upon the place, and his Accounts too being but very lately retriv'd and recover'd to the World, it can be no unacceptable entertainment to the Reader to be briefly acquainted with them.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. <hi>DIOCLETIAN</hi> was a Man infinitely superstitious,<note place="margin">Lact. de mort. persec. c. <hi>10, 11.</hi> &amp; seqq. p. <hi>20.</hi> &amp;c.</note> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly fearful and jealous of future Events, and upon that account miserably devoted to Southsaying and Divination, for which reason there never wanted enough of that divining Tribe to attend the Court. It happen'd, that while they were busie one day at their divinatory Sacrifices, certain Christian Priests crept in among the crowd, who
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49523:338"/> secretly making the sign of the Cross upon their Foreheads, the <hi>Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> immediately vanish'd, and all was left in disturbance and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. The <hi>Aruspices</hi> trembled, not being able to discern any of the wonted signs in the Entrails of the Sacrifices, and, as if they had mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken or fail'd in some <hi>Punctilio's,</hi> began anew, and frequently repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, but to as little purpose as before. Whereupon <hi>Tages,</hi> Master of the Ceremonies, either seeing the persons, or suspecting them, cried out, that the reason why the Sacrifices did not give their wonted significations, was, because prophane persons had mix'd themselves with the holy Solemnities. The Emperour enrag'd hereat, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all present to do Sacrifice, and all that were in the Palace, under pain of Stripes and Violence; and by a Warrant to the Commanders, order'd all the Soldiers in the Army to do the like, or immediately be discharg'd. Not long after came <hi>Galerius Maximianus,</hi> whom <hi>Diocle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> some years since had created <hi>Caesar,</hi> a zealous Pagan, who set him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to blow up the Emperour into a violent persecution of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians. But none plied him harder than his Mother, a Woman super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious beyond measure, and who had a most inveterate spite against Christianity. These three held private Cabals all the Winter, and while 'twas believ'd abroad, that they were in deep Consults about State-affairs, they were only hammering out a Persecution against the Christians. <hi>Diocletian</hi> was old, and lov'd his ease, and therefore did not readily listen to violent Councils; he urg'd how dangerous a thing it was to disquiet the Empire, and to hurry the World into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion and blood; that such severities would be ineffectual, the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians desiring nothing more than Death and Martyrdom; and that it would be enough, if the Court and the Army were purg'd from the Men of that Religion. Finding this would not do, he betook himself to his old King-craft, which was in all great and generous acts to resolve upon them without taking any advice, that so the honour of them might reflect upon himself alone; but where the thing was like to prove mischievous and distastful, he was wont to take several Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers into Council, that so the blame might fall upon them. This he practic'd in this case; he declares he will hear the opinion of his Friends and Confidents, whereupon some Judges and Military Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders are taken in, who all comply with the council of the Empress and <hi>Maximian.</hi> The Emperour not yet satisfied, sends to consult the Oracle of <hi>Apollo Milesius,</hi> who, we may be sure, return'd an answer home to the purpose. And now all excuses being remov'd, he yields, but still persuades the more moderate course, that it might be done without Blood, while <hi>Maximian</hi> insists, that they may be burnt alive. The time prefix'd to begin this tragic Scene, was the seventh of the <hi>Calends</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> when the <hi>Terminalia</hi> were usually celebrated among the <hi>Romans,</hi> and this chosen as an auspicious <hi>Omen,</hi> that they should put a <hi>term</hi> and period to that Religion. The day being come, ('twas the xxiii<seg rend="sup">d</seg> of <hi>February, Ann. Chr.</hi> CCCIII.) early in the Morning the Emperour with his Guards and Officers goes to the Church of the Christians, and having broken open the Doors, sought for the Image of the God they worship'd; but finding none, took the Bibles, and other things at hand, and threw them into the Fire, filling all places with force and violence. It held some Debate, whether they should set the Church on fire, but the Emperour over-rul'd that, as what
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49523:338"/> might be of fatal consequence to the City; whereupon Officers were set on work, who pull'd it down to the ground. The next day an Edict was publish'd to strip the Christians of all Honours, Offices, Priviledges, and that no quality or condition should exempt them from the Rack and Torture, and that they should have no power at Law in any case to vindicate and right themselves, and to that end Altars were set up in the Courts of Judicature, and every one was to offer Sacrifice, before he could have liberty to plead his Cause. And now <hi>Maximian</hi> to strike home, secretly causes the Imperial Palace to be set on fire, (but so, that it might be easily quench'd) and then charges it upon the Christians, who, he tells the Emperour, had done it out of envy, and had conspir'd with the Eunuchs to murder the Emperour, and that they had been in great danger of being both burnt alive. This put <hi>Diocletian</hi> into a passion beyond all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straints of Reason, or giving himself a respit for cool and impartial Considerations. Orders are issued out to proceed against Christians without mercy, and he himself sits and sees them executed in part, the rest was done by his Judges and Officers, and all the emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was, who should be most bloody and cruel. No regard is had to Sex, Age, or Order, and not content with single Executions, whole House-fulls are burnt at once, and Droves tied together with Ropes are thrown into the Sea: Prisons are crowded, and new instruments of Torture are invented, and Letters written to the <hi>Western</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours to pursue the same methods in those Parts. By which means the Persecution became universal, and unless where <hi>Constantius</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd, was carried on with almost equal cruelty in all Parts. The particulars whereof it is not my business here to relate.</p>

By the Philosopher <hi>Baronius</hi>
                     <note n="m" place="margin">Ad Ann. <hi>302,</hi> N, LI. LVII.</note> will needs understand <hi>Porphyry,</hi> the famous and known Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of Christians. But the Character <hi>Lactantius</hi> gives him, no way suits, either with <hi>Porphyries,</hi> Age, or Temper. <hi>Porphyry</hi> was a Man of a most strict, severe, and mortified Life; <hi>Lactantius</hi>'s Philosopher servile, covetous, voluptuous, and every way debauch'd and vicious. And tho we could suppose <hi>Porphyry</hi> to have been a Man of this humour, yet his great Age (being at this time near seventy Years old) would have render'd him incapable of those loose Extravagancies which <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctantius</hi> charges upon his Philosopher: Not to mention that <hi>Porphyry</hi> wrote no less than thirty Books against the Christians, this no more than three. By the other, the Judge, we are doubtless to understand <hi>Hierocles,</hi> (and so indeed elsewhere<note n="n" place="margin">De mort. persec. c. <hi>16.</hi> p. <hi>30.</hi>
                     </note> he expresly tells us) who from a <hi>Vicarius</hi> had been made President, and had been one of the prime coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors and promoters of the Persecution. A Man of greater Parts, and better Manners, but an irreconcilable Enemy to the Christian name, against which he wrote with great salt and sharpness. Two
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49523:339"/> Books he publish'd, which he styl'd <gap reason="foreign">

In short, so ready and dexterous was he at quoting the Holy Writings, that my Author was almost tempted to think he had once been a Christian. And did other circumstances concur, his spite and zeal would be no small arguments to strengthen the conjecture, Apostates being ever the most bitter and virulent opposers of that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which they have deserted.</p>

                     </note> their Discourses in the presence of <hi>Lactantius,</hi> who was not a little troubled to see the best Religion in the World thus openly and insolently affronted; and being as 'twere thus boldly challeng'd, and arm'd with the advantages of so good a Cause, he resolv'd to put Pen to Paper, not so much to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter these trifling Antagonists, (whose strength, he tells us, he could have routed in a few words) as to undertake the general defence of Christianity against all aggressors of that kind, and at once to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able all their attempts against it. Accordingly as his Master <hi>Arnobius</hi> did just about the same time in seven Books stoutly defend the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Cause against the Pagans, so he compos'd seven Books of <hi>Divine Institutions;</hi> in the first whereof he treats concerning the <hi>false Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> and having assign'd several Causes of his undertaking, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to assert and prove a Providence, and next that there is but one God that made and governs the World, which he evinces both by Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments and Authorities, the testimonies of Prophets, Poets, Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers, <hi>Sibyls,</hi> and Oracles, and rationally refutes the Religion of the <hi>Gentile</hi>-World, especially that which obtain'd in the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, shewing that the Deities which they worship'd were altogether unworthy of the title and place of Gods. In the second Book he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses concerning the <hi>Origine of Error,</hi> demonstrates at large the vanity of the Pagan Religion, and enquires how the <hi>Romans</hi> came to fall under so many absurd Errors and Mistakes, and indeed how Mankind came to lapse under so prodigious a degeneracy in matters of Divine Worship, which he charges chiefly upon the great corruption and apostacy of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Posterity, and the subtle snares and stratagems of the Devil. The third is concerning <hi>false Wisdom,</hi> wherein the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Philosophy and Philosophers, and their false pretences to true Wisdom, are admirably represented. As in the fourth he treats of the <hi>true Wisdom,</hi> and having first complain'd of the prevalency of <hi>Pagan</hi> Impiety, and enquir'd why their great Masters of Philosophy never found true Wisdom, because they sought it not in its right place, there being an inseparable union between true Wisdom and Religion, no where to be met with but among Christians; he next displays the true Knowledge of Christ, both as to his Person, Name, Birth, Nature, and that both divine and humane, Miracles, Sufferings, and Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixion; enquiring likewise how our owning both Father and Son to be God, can consist with the Unity of the Deity; lastly, what are the usual causes of Heresy, which he shews to be Pride, Covetousness,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49523:339"/> ignorance of Scripture, and an over-fond valuation of false Teachers and Prophets. The fifth Book treats of <hi>Justice,</hi> wherein he gives an account why he set upon this whole Work, then shews that Justice and Righteousness how much soever boasted of by Philosophers, was possess'd only by Christians, that it was an unreasonable Cruelty in the Pagans to persecute these just and righteous Persons, however God for wise and good ends thought fit to suffer it. In the sixth he discourses concerning <hi>true Worship,</hi> both inward, as it respects the temper and disposition of the Mind, and outward, as it relates to the carriage of the Life; and rectifies the mistakes of the Philosophers and great Men among the Heathens about the several Vertues of a good Life. The seventh and last part is <hi>De vita beata,</hi> or the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Life to come; wherein he shews, that the true <hi>Summum bonum,</hi> or reward of Virtue, consists in a state of future Immortality, that the Souls of Men are thus immortal, notwithstanding what some of the Philosophers have said to the contrary, and what it is that capacitates a Man for this Eternal State: Then he discourses concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the end of the World, and the Signs that shall precede it, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Day of Judgment, and the Reign of a thousand Years, and the consequent state that shall ensue upon it. And having thus dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd his main Argument, he shuts up the whole with a pathetical Exhortation to call off our Minds from things present and sensible, and heartily to entertain and comply with this excellent Religion, as the only way to attain to this happy and immortal Life. This is the sum of his several Dissertations, which being finish'd, he is generally said to have dedicated them to <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, and both towards the beginning and the conclusion of the Book, there are particular and formal Addresses and Dedications to him. But the case is somewhat more than suspicious. In the first Address he is said to have begun this Work under <hi>Constantine,</hi> whereas <hi>Lactantius</hi> himself assures us, he set upon it not long after the beginning of the <hi>Diocletian</hi> Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the cruelty and universality whereof he more than once and again complains of, but the Persecution of <hi>Licinius</hi> (under which they suppose he wrote it) was only topical, confin'd to some places in the <hi>East,</hi> and never reach'd the <hi>Western</hi> Parts: He farther tells us, he engag'd in it, when he taught Oratory at <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> and when <hi>Hierocles,</hi> who was then one of the Judges there, wrote against Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity; now <hi>Hierocles</hi> was soon after remov'd to the Government of <hi>Egypt</hi> to carry on the Persecution there. So that it's plain, these Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses must be of a later Date, and inserted by some other hand, and accordingly (which puts the case past all dispute) are wanting not only in some of the first Editions, but in most, if not all, of the best and most ancient Copies of these Institutions. This Work he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards abridg'd into an <hi>Epitome</hi> for the more ease and advantage of common Readers, some part whereof, <hi>viz.</hi> of the three last Books, is still extant, tho perhaps as much as was in S. <hi>Jerom</hi>'s time, when it was <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="6">VI. NEAR ten years the Persecution had now continued, with all imaginable fierceness and violence, when <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, some years since advanc'd to the Empire, having embrac'd the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Faith, began to put a stop to it. He had by his Lady <hi>Minervina,</hi> suppos'd generally to be his Concubine, but one Son called <hi>Crispus,</hi> a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49523:340"/> Prince of hopeful Virtues, and whom he then entirely lov'd, and took all possible care of his Education. <hi>Constantine</hi> had himself liv'd some years in the Court of <hi>Diocletian,</hi> at the same time that <hi>Lactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> was at <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> with whom no doubt he had some acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and having taken notice of the Learning and Honesty of the Man, sent for him into <hi>France</hi> to be Tutor to the young Prince, and to instruct him particularly in the Learning and Eloquence of the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue.

To which end he drew up a Discourse <hi>De persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione,</hi> or <hi>De mortibus persecutorum,</hi> wherein from the very beginnings of Christianity he briefly traces that signal and remarkable Vengeance from Heaven that had pursued the most eminent Persecutors of the Church, which he draws down to the times of <hi>Diocletian,</hi> and there enlarges himself as to the rise, cruelty, and extent of that Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and those dreadful Punishments which God inflicted upon that Emperour, and all his Collegues and Partners, <hi>Maximianus Herculius, Galerius Maximianus, Severus, Maximinus Daza, Maxentius,</hi> and <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinius,</hi> and how after all attempts God crown'd the Piety of the great <hi>Constantine</hi> with Victory and Success, the Church with Ease and Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the World with Peace. This Book (as he did also that <hi>De Ira Dei</hi>) he dedicated to his dear friend <hi>Donatus,</hi> who had been an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Confessor<note n="q" place="margin">Vid. ejusd. ib. c. <hi>16.</hi> p. <hi>30.</hi>

His Parts were prompt and quick, his Judgment sagacious; whatever Argument he takes in hand, he manages with that strength and clearness, that he always with ease carries the day.

Besides, many things are clear to us, which to them were in the dark, not yet sufficiently beaten out; many Questions intricate and dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, as wherein the Church had then made no precise and dogmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal determination. Some Errors are the fault of the Age, rather than the Person, and many things are to be pardon'd to humane Weakness, and want of sufficient Light. His <hi>Chiliastic</hi> notions were common to him with several of the greatest note for Learning and Piety in the Church, as we have shewn elsewhere.<note n="y" place="margin">Life of S. Just. M. N.

However, this I think may be safely said, that for the sublimeness of his Matter, the frequent pithiness of his Sentences, the sweetness and pleasantness of his Periods, the clearness and evenness of his Style, (whose greatest fault it may be is, that 'tis too smooth and fine) he has since the <hi>Ciceronian</hi> Age had few equal, and perhaps none supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to him.</p>

The news of this barbarous and unjustifiable action was soon carried to the Emperour,<note n="o" place="margin">Vid. Liban. Orat. III. Basil. dict. p. <hi>127, 128.</hi>

Nor did <hi>Macedonius</hi> himself escape without a brand of the Emperour's Displeasure, who was offended at him, both because he had presum'd to be made Bishop without his leave, and because he had been part-cause of the late Tumults and Murders that had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd, and therefore suspended the execution of his place, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd him only to officiate in the Church wherein he had receiv'd his Ordination.</p>

He sends for the Bishop to come to him to <hi>Zeuxippus</hi> his Bath, under pretence of business that did greately import and concern the public, and therefore commanded his speedy attendance. <hi>Paul</hi> obeys, and being come into the house, the Governour shews him the Emperours Warrant, whereat the good Bishop was nothing daunted, though he thought it hard measure to be condemn'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any cause shewn, or being admitted to answer for himself. <hi>Philip</hi> dar'd not to trust the multitude, who suspecting some ill design against their Bishop, had flockt to the gates, and therefore ordered a back dore of the Bath to be opened, by which <hi>Paul</hi> was convey'd into the Pallace, and thence immediately put a Ship-board, and sent into Banishment. The place appointed was <hi>Cucusus,</hi> a disconsolate and miserable Town in <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> but afterwards lay'd to the <hi>second Armenia,</hi> where there was nothing but Rocks and Wildness, Cold and Hunger to entertain him. But this it seems they thought too good for him, and that while they afforded him breath,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49523:343"/> they could never account themselves secure enough. Therefore to make sure the work, they dispatch messengers after him, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the place, shut him up in a close and dark dungeon, without permitting any one to come near him, or the least bit of food to be given him. After six days they came into the room, expecting to have found him starv'd to death, but observing him yet to draw his breath, they strangled him with his own Cloaths, and then to colour the murder, gave it out that he died of a disease, though the whole Vicenage knew the contrary, and <hi>Philagrius</hi> who was <hi>Vicarius</hi> or Governour of that Province, and Servant enough to the <hi>Arian</hi> faction, told it with some wonder and amazement to several, and among the rest to <hi>Sarapion</hi> an <hi>Egyptian</hi> Bishop, from whose mouth <hi>Athanasius</hi> reports it. But see how remarkably the Divine Justice overtook <hi>Philip,</hi> the prime agent, that plotted, contriv'd, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted this whole scheme of villany. Scarce had twelve months gone over his head, when he was disgracefully turn'd out of all his honours and offices, and made a scorn and reproach to all his enemies. Which made so deep an impression upon his mind, that as if he inherited <hi>Cains</hi> curse he went up and down like a Vagabond and a Wanderer, ran from place to place, but was still pursued by his guilty conscience, and expected that every one that found him, should slay him, till no longer able to hold up his head, he ended his miserable Life, far both from his Friends and Country.</p>

But whatever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of our Martyrs Bones, they were the only remains he left behind him, having consign'd gnothing that we know of to writing to preserve his memory; his peculiar talent lay in Preaching, and by that he infinitely endear'd himself to the people.

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49523:344"/> perhaps less stomach to write Books, whose mind was continually disquieted with his own personal sufferings, but much more with the evils and troubles that befell the Church of God.</p>

This Declaration they subscrib'd, but according to the guise of the men, who were wont to change with every wind, afterwards retracted it, and went again over to the <hi>Arians.</hi>

                  <p n="4">IV. SOON after the Assembly at <hi>Milan,</hi> by the great instance and importunity which Pope <hi>Julius</hi> us'd with the Emperour <hi>Constans,</hi> and he with his Brother <hi>Constantius,</hi> a more general Synod was holden at <hi>Sardica,</hi> where the <hi>Eastern</hi> Bishops refus'd to joyn with them of the <hi>West,</hi> unless <hi>Athanasius</hi> and his fellow-sufferers were first expell'd their company: Which not being yielded to, the Synod was kept in separate meetings; the <hi>Orientalists</hi> in their Assembly confirm'd what had been heretofore done against <hi>Athanasius</hi> and his partners, depose<note n="g" place="margin">Vid. Epist. Orient. ap. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar. in fragm. Col. <hi>446.</hi>
                     </note> several of the most eminent Bishops of the other side, and among them especially <hi>Julius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome, ut principem &amp; ducem malorum</hi> (as they stile him) as the Captain and Ring-leader of the whole mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, as he that had first set open the dore to Communion with wicked and condemned Persons, and had chalkt out the way for others to trample upon the Laws of Religion and the Church, and had boldly presum'd to defend <hi>Athanasius,</hi> a person whose neither witnesses nor accusers he had heard. In the Catholic Synod <hi>Athanasius</hi> and the rest were heard, absolv'd and restor'd, and the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49523:345"/> confirm'd, and a Letter written to <hi>Julius,</hi> to let him know what was done, and to desire him to disperse the Synodal Decrees about those parts. Among the Canons past in this Council, the III. IV. and V. are in favour of Pope <hi>Julius,</hi> granting him power to receive appeals out of other Provinces, where, if Bishops were aggriev'd at home, or unjustly depos'd, or that their Case could not conveniently be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd, that they might have recourse to <hi>Julius</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> who should have power to appoint Commissioners to hear and decide those Causes. Which yet did not invest the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishops with any standing supereminent Prerogative over the rest of the Church, but only made provisionary Decrees to comply with the present exigences and necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Church. As is evident to any one that considers the state of the Church at that time, when the <hi>Arians</hi> having fill'd all corners, and possess'd themselves of all eminent Bishopricks, bore hard upon the Catholic Bishops in all places, who were thrust out and banisht, nor could they have any right done them at home, as was plain in the Case of <hi>Athanasius, Asclepas,</hi> &amp;c. who were then in Council, and were the only occasion of the calling of it: Which made it necessary to have some certain person to recurr to upon such occasions; and who could be so proper for that purpose as the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> which as it was the most eminent and illustrious See, so were its Bishops in those days most renown'd, for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity and firm adherence to the Catholick Cause. And indeed the Canons seem to entail this priviledge rather upon the person of Pope <hi>Julius,</hi> than upon the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> as not designing it for a standing, and unalterable Law, but which was to expire with the occasion of it. In short, as the <hi>Sardican</hi> Council was never accounted any other than a particular Synod, so neither were the Decrees of it held in any great reverence and estimation, as appear'd in the beginning of the following <hi>Saeculum</hi> in the known Case of Appeals in the <hi>African</hi> Church, whereof more in another place. The Council at <hi>Sardica</hi> being dissolv'd, <hi>Athanasius</hi> not long after was recall'd by Letters from <hi>Constantius,</hi> and accordingly went to <hi>Rome</hi> to take his leave of his dear Friend <hi>Julius,</hi> who heartily rejoyc'd in his good success, and wrote<note n="h" place="margin">Ecl. Epist. ap. Ath. Apol. II.</note> by him to the Clergy and People of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> to Congratulate the return of their excellent Bishop, whom he highly commends as for other things, so for his constant and couragious suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for the cause of Christ.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. THUS far we have view'd him in his more public actings, nor was he less careful and industrious in his private station. Besides the welfare of his charge, he studied to add to the external beauty and magnificence of his See. Two new Churches he erected at <hi>Rome,</hi> one near the <hi>Forum Romanum,</hi> the other in the <hi>Via Flaminia</hi> within the <hi>Transtiberine</hi> Region; he Built three <hi>Coemiteries</hi> or Burying-places, one in the <hi>Flaminian</hi> way, another in the <hi>Aurelian,</hi> and the third in the <hi>Via Portuensis.</hi> He ordain'd that no Clergy-man should try his Cause any where but in the Ecclesiastical Court, and that Notaries should make Acts and Registers of all that was done, the care whereof was to lie upon the Protonotary, who was to superintend those Records. He died the XII. of <hi>April, Ann.</hi> CCCLII. after he had sitten in the Chair Fifteen years, one month, and eleven days, (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Ancient Catalogue mention'd before, but to make up
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49523:346"/> the time exact from <hi>February</hi> the VI. to the XII. of <hi>April</hi> almost a month more must be allow'd) and was Buried in the Coemitery of <hi>Calepodius</hi> in the <hi>Aurelian</hi> way. He left nothing in writing behind him besides a few Epistles, and some of them too, as now extant, spurious. And indeed they began this trade with his name betimes. Not long after his death an Epistle was produc'd as if written by him to <hi>Dionysius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Corinth</hi> concerning the incarnation of our Lord, favouring some of the heretical principles of those times, which therefore so puzzl'd <hi>Gennadius,</hi>

He tells us likewise of another inserted under his name into the Acts of the Council of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> but written truly by <hi>Timotheus,</hi> one of the main sticklers for the Doctrine of <hi>Apollinaris.</hi>

                     </note> of an antient and noble Family at <hi>Edessa,</hi> a chief City in <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopotamia,</hi> where Christianity had been ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly planted by <hi>Thaddaeus</hi> one of the Seventy, and cultivated by the after endeavours of St. <hi>Jude</hi> the Apostle; and had taken such deep root, that it flourished in all suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding times, and no City in all the <hi>Eastern</hi> Parts became so famous for its zealous and resolute Profession of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Faith. He was like a second <hi>Timothy, from his Childhood ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the holy Scriptures,</hi> according to the pious custom of that place; where one of the first things they did, was to instill the Rudiments of the Faith into their Children, that so their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and Religion might grow up together. Next he was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the ablest Masters of Humane Learning in that City, by whom he was instructed in all the Eloquence, Wisdom and Philosophy of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> wherein he became one of the greatest Masters of that age. But still he thought he wanted the accomplishment of that more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Philosophy, which Christianity had taught the World. For which end he put himself under the Discipline of two of the most Learned Scholars of those times; <hi>Eusebius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Caesarea,</hi> and <hi>Patrophilus</hi> of <hi>Scythopolis;</hi> under whom he studied Theology, and the Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49523:347"/> of the sacred Scriptures: and from them, 'tis like he borrowed some notions, that made him afterwards suspect d of an inclination towards <hi>Arianism.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">II. THUS furnisht, he came and setled himself at <hi>Antioch,</hi> the most eminent City of the <hi>East,</hi> at the time when <hi>Eustathius</hi> the venerable Bishop of that See, was accused by <hi>Cyrus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Beraea,</hi> as a favourer of <hi>Sabellianism,</hi> for which he was deposed; though there was something else that lay at the bottom. He liv'd some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time with <hi>Euphronius,</hi> one of them that succeeded <hi>Eustathius,</hi> and that with so great fame and reputation, that he was press'd to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a Bishoprick; and that with so much earnestness, that to avoid the importunity, he resolved to quit that place. Indeed his vast and capacious Soul was not yet satisfied with those great attainments he had already made; but was still roving after farther measures and degrees of knowledge, and to that purpose he went to <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi> where there were the most famous Professors of all the more abstruse and mysterious parts of Learning. Here he perfected himself in the utmost improvements of Philosophy; after which, he returned back to <hi>Antioch,</hi> and liv'd familiarly with <hi>Flaccillus, Euphronius</hi>'s Successor in that See.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. <hi>A N.</hi> CCCXLI. <hi>Eusebius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Constantinople</hi> conspiring with the chief of the <hi>Arian</hi> Party, held a great Council at <hi>Antioch;</hi> wherein among other things, having condemn'd and depos'd <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius,</hi> their next work was to fill up his See. And for that, none appear'd every ways so fitly qualified as our <hi>Eusebius;</hi> a man of a strict life and eloquent tongue, whereby they hoped he would be able to charm the people of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and bring them off from their unreasonable fondness of <hi>Athanasius.</hi> But he prudently declin'd the offer, wisely considering how uneasy that Chair must be to any man, out of which <hi>Athanasius</hi> had been turn'd; for whom he knew the People had a most dear regard, and that they would not endure any to be thrust up into his room. But though the Synod could not prevail with him in this matter, yet were they loth the Church should lose so useful and excellent a Person; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore perswaded him to accept the Bishoprick of <hi>Emisa,</hi> a City in <hi>Phaenicia,</hi> near Mount <hi>Libanus,</hi> not many Miles distant from <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicea.</hi> Thither he went to receive his Consecration, but the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple informed of his incomparable skill in <hi>Astronomy</hi> and the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks,</hi> cried out against him as a Conjurer, and mutined a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his Ordination; so that foreseeing how little quiet he was to expect among them, he left them, and went to <hi>Laodicea,</hi> to his dear and intimate Friend <hi>George</hi> Bishop of that place, who surviv'd him, and wrote his Life. <hi>George</hi> brought him back to <hi>Antioch,</hi> where upon consultation with <hi>Flaccillus</hi> and <hi>Narcissus,</hi> it was resolved that he should return to his charge at <hi>Emisa;</hi> which he did according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and where 'tis probable he continued till his death, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened about the year CCCLX, not long before that of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Constantius;</hi> he died and was buried at <hi>Antioch,</hi> the place where he had spent a considerable portion of his Life.</p>
                  <p>HE was of great esteem in the age he liv'd in, highly honour'd by <hi>Constantius</hi> himself; who was so exceedingly delighted in his Company, that he used to take him along with him in his <hi>Persian</hi>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:49523:347"/> Expeditions; and if <hi>George</hi> of <hi>Laodicea</hi> may be credited, he was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for many miracles which he wrought. He passes under a very different character; by some he is said to have been an <hi>Arian,</hi> and by S. <hi>Jerom</hi>
                     <note n="m" place="margin">Chron. An. CCCXLVIII.</note> to have been <hi>Arianae signifer factionis</hi> (a Title which he claps upon more than one <hi>Eusebius</hi>) though when he speaks of him elsewhere<note n="n" place="margin">De Script. c. <hi>91.</hi>
                     </note> more fully, he says no such matter. By others he was directly charged with <hi>Sabellianism,</hi> but it was by such says <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zomen,</hi> who were enviously tormented with the virtues of others. Were his Writings Extant, they would enable us to judge more cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically and certainly in this matter. All that we can now guess is, that from his ordinary corresponding with the <hi>Arians,</hi> he lean'd towards that side; and perhaps was of the moderate or <hi>Homoiousian</hi> Party. He was a man says St. <hi>Jerom, Elegantis &amp; rhetorici ingenit,</hi> of neat and eloquent parts, and wrote many Books and Discourses; and those in a popular and familiar strain: in his expounding Scripture, he kept most commonly to the Literal sence, as the truest and most immediate way to understand its meaning. He imploy'd his Pen against <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles, Novatians,</hi> and such like; and in writing brief Notes and Strictures upon the Gospels. Vast numbers of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies have been heretofore publisht under his Name; which 'tis plain were the works of <hi>Eucherius</hi> of <hi>Lions,</hi> and several others. Nothing genuine of his, has yet been brought to light; though it may perhaps deserve the Readers enquiry, whether those XIII Books or Homilies confidently publisht by <hi>Sirmond,</hi> under the name of <hi>Eusebius Caesariensis,</hi> be not rather the work of this <hi>Eusebius</hi> who was his Scholar; and who it may be, compos'd the two first, which are against <hi>Sabellius,</hi> to clear himself from the charge of that He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy. Certain it is, that they favour not the vein and way of Writing used by the <hi>Caesarean Eusebius.</hi> Nor has <hi>Sirmond</hi> any ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument or authority to support his confidence, more than that he found it so inscrib'd in the antient Copy. And who knows not how easy it was for Transcribers, when they met with a work intitled to <hi>Eusebius,</hi> to clap <hi>Pamphilus</hi> to it, as supposing it to belong to <hi>Eusebius</hi> of <hi>Caesarea,</hi> as the person best known among the Writers of the <hi>Latin</hi> Church. But in this I leave every one to his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture.</p>

By which means, he attained to a vast comprehension of divine knowledge, which with a mighty grace and eloquence flowed naturally from him. And this Heaven was pleas'd to signify to him by a vision<note n="r" place="margin">Nyss. ib. p. <hi>1037.</hi>
                     </note> in his early years (which he was wont oft to speak of) he thought he saw a most fruitful Vine growing from the root of his tongue, which did so spread and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large it self, that it fill'd the whole earth, and all the Fowls of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven came and eat of the fruit of it; while the Vine, the more it was pluckt, and its fruit devoured, did so much the farther encrease, and was loaded with more and heavier clusters. A clear represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of that plentiful portion of divine and excellent gifts, wherewith Heaven was resolved to crown his Studies. And it fell out accordingly, for while he yet understood little (if any thing) more than the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage<note n="s" place="margin">Sozom. loc. clt.</note> of his own Countrey, besides his profound skill in Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, he attained to a vast proficiency in forreign Learning; so as to be able to master the hardest and most difficult <hi>Theorems</hi> in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy, and by the wisdom, clearness, and eloquency of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses out-went the wisest sages of <hi>Greece.</hi>

                  <p n="2">II. THE former part of his age, he spent in solitudes,<note n="t" place="margin">Myss. ib. p. <hi>1036.</hi>
                     </note> and the exercises of a retired life; where being free from the noise and crowd, he might quietly converse with Angels, and entertain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with pious and divine contemplations. But God seasonably brought it into his mind, that we were not born meerly for our selves, but were obliged to help forwards the wellfare and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of others. This made him resolve to quit his solitary recess, and betake himself to the great City of <hi>Edessa,</hi> both that he might partake in the benefit of their public and solemn Assemblies, and meet with some wise and good man, unto whose conduct and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction he might commit himself, and from whom he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive further knowledge himself, or at least might have an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to impart it unto others. At his entrance<note n="u" place="margin">Vid. etiam Soz. ubi supr,</note> into the gate of the City, instead of the wise man he had so much wisht for, he met with a common Strumpet, who earnestly fixt her eyes upon him, while he ashamed to fall so short of his expectation, turn'd his face from her. Woman, <hi>said he,</hi> tell me why dost thee so wishly behold me? I do, replied the Woman, and not without reason; for what can be more fit and proper, than to look up to thee, out of whom, as the Man, was I form'd and made, whereas thou oughtest to look not to me, but to the ground, out of which thou wast created. An answer which he did not expect, and he inwardly blessed the Divine providence, that had turned the chance to so good advantage; and was so greatly delighted with the remembrance of it, that he wrote a Book particularly upon that occasion; esteemed one of the best he ever wrote.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. AT <hi>Edessa</hi> he fixt his station, where though he was in the midst of a Populous City, he kept to the strictness of a monastic life, by the severities whereof, he perfectly conquered all extravagant pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49523:349"/> so that though naturally extreamly inclin'd to choller, he so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely subdued it, that he was never after seen to be angry in all his life. When he espied his man under some terror and consternation for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving spilt the dinner he was bringing to him, after he had fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed several days together (as he often did) he pleasantly told him, don't be troubled, let us go to the meat, since the meat will not come to us, and so went and sat down, and took his repast of the fragments that were left upon the broken shivers of the Pot. Besides the constant returns of private Devotion, he preacht fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and with infinite satisfaction to the People. Scholars he had in great numbers, that diligently attended upon his Lectures, who became famous in those parts of the World; such as <hi>Abbas, Zenobius, Habraam, Maras, Symeones, Paulonas,</hi> and <hi>Aranad,</hi> though the two last turn'd aside to the Errors of <hi>Apollinaris.</hi> He attained no higher degree than that of Deacon in the Church of <hi>Edessa;</hi> not that he might not, but that he would not. He was elected to a Bishoprick (probably the See of <hi>Edessa</hi>) and the Order was bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, and persons sent to conduct him to his Ordination. Which he no sooner got notice of, but in a frantic manner, and with his garments hanging loose, and dragging after him, he ran in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Forum;</hi> where he fell to his victuals, and by uncouth and fantastic gestures put on the habit of a Mad man. Which when they who were sent to apprehend him, found, they dismist him as a man distracted; by which means he gain'd an opportunity to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, and conceal'd himself, till another person was ordain'd to the place.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. ABOUT the year CCCLXX, he took a journey, and that as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self tells us,<note n="w" place="margin">Eph. Orat. de Laud. Basil. Tom. <hi>3.</hi> p. <hi>534.</hi>
                     </note> by a divine admonition, to <hi>Caesarea</hi> in <hi>Cappadocia;</hi> where he saw and with admiration heard the great S. <hi>Basil</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the People of that place; and remarkt the order and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, the ardor and piety of their devotions: and wha's more, we are told,<note n="x" place="margin">Nyss. ubi supr. p. <hi>1037.</hi>
                     </note> that he beheld a bright shining Dove sitting upon <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sils</hi> right Shoulder, prompting him with words of heavenly wisdom, which he immediately scattered among the people. <hi>Basil</hi> had it made known to him, who this great man was; and calling him to him, askt him by an interpreter, whether he was not <hi>Ephraim;</hi> upon whose confession, he saluted him with the most endear'd embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, entred into mutual Conferences and Discourses; the venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Bishop imparting to him at his request, the most excellent Rules for the Government of the Divine Life. Loaded with the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of a well spent journey, <hi>Ephraim</hi> returns to <hi>Edessa;</hi> where he improv'd the small remainder of his life, to the most public and useful purposes. Not long before his death, a severe famine<note n="y" place="margin">Sozom. ib. p. <hi>527.</hi>
                     </note> raged in the City, and the helpless died in great multitudes unregarded. He waited some time to see what care would be taken in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon calamity; but finding little or none, he left his Cell, and sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reprov'd the rich and the wealthy, for suffering their poor Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to starve; while they hoarded up their stores to the ruine of their own souls, which he shewed them were of infinitely more value than all their riches, or whatever else concern'd the body, how much soever they slighted and neglected them. The men were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sham'd, and turn'd it off by telling him, they did not stand so much
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49523:349"/> upon their money, but the world was so bad, so full of fraud and self-interest, that they knew not where to find a man in whose hands they might safely trust this affair. He askt them what they thought of him? they all confessed they lookt upon him as a good man, a very honest and faithful person; <hi>why then,</hi> said he, <hi>I will undertake it.</hi> So receiving their Charity, he caus'd three hundred beds to be brought into the public Cloisters of the City; and those whom want and languishment had made weak and impotent, to be plac'd in them; whom he provided both of Food and Physic. He took care also of Strangers, and those whom necessity had driven out of the neighbouring Countrey; and furnisht them with all necessary accommodations. And thus he continued till the dearth abated, and then he returned back to his Cell again; and within few days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, was arrested with his last sickness. Lying upon his Death-bed<note n="z" place="margin">Nyss. ib. p. <hi>1039.</hi>
                     </note>, he strictly charged his attendants to abstain from any pompous solemnity at his Funeral, that they should sing no funeral Hymns, nor have any encomiastic Oration at his Burial, provide no costly shrouds to inwrap him, nor any peculiar Monument to receive him; that he desired nothing but the portion of a Pilgrim, for that he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted himself but as a <hi>Stranger and Sojourner as all his Fathers were;</hi> that if any person out of respect to him, had design'd any such chargeable kindness, they should divert the cost, and bestow it upon the poor.

                     </note> who had provided a very rich and costly Shroud for his interment; which he thought too good to give to the Poor, and resolved rather to give its value in Money. Whereupon (says mine Author, a Person of unquestionable credit, who liv'd at that time, and in those parts of the World) he was immediately taken after the manner of a pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed Person; and fell down at the Bed-side, foaming and tearing like the most wild <hi>Demoniac.</hi> The good man espying the sad spec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle, askt him what he had done to bring this upon him, who presently confest the truth; whereupon <hi>Ephraim</hi> laid his hands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and having pray'd for him, restor'd him to his health and senses, and dismist him with this charge, <hi>go thy way Friend, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form what thou hast long since propos'd and promised to thy self.</hi> After this, reflecting upon the course of his own life, he told the Company, Never in my whole life (said he)<note n="b" place="margin">Ibid. p. <hi>1039.</hi>

So long as his breath served, he most earnestly prest all about him to a vigorous emulation in the practice of goodness and virtue, as his last Discourse (says <hi>Nyssene</hi>

His great zeal for truth, made him readily encounter with any error, which he refuted with no little warmth and briskness, both by discourse and writing.

The woman assents, and he takes the Books along with him; and having brought them home, glues all the Leaves fast to one another; and so carries them back, without any visible sign of what had been done to them. Not long after he put some of the Catholic Party upon the challenging <hi>Apollinaris</hi> to a Dispute; the day is set, and <hi>Apollinaris</hi> appears, and desires of the Company, that by reason of his great age he might not be prest to dispute verbally, but might be suffered to argue or answer out of his Book. So taking one of the Books from his Companion, he began to open it, but it would not stir; he tried in the middle, but 'twas as fast there as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Then he took the other Book, but found both alike, not one Leaf parting from another; which did so amaze and confound the man, that like one forsaken of his reason, rose he up and ran out of the Meeting, and was so unable to sustain the shame and ignominy, that it brought a Disease upon him, that had like to have cost his life.</p>

And his Discourses had this peculiar excellency, that contrary to the fate of all other versions, being translated out of the <hi>Syriac</hi> (for he always spoke and wrote in his mother tongue) into <hi>Greek,</hi> they lost nothing of their native grace and elegancy; but what was admired in its own proper garb, was little less admirable when cloathed in a foreign Dress.

Many of them were in his life time translated into <hi>Greek,</hi> and the rest afterwards; and were greedily read by all with equal admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and delight.

There was at this time a woful schism in that Church, which happened upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. <hi>Liberius</hi> being banisht by the Emperor <hi>Constantius</hi> for his constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to the Catholic interest, the Clergy of that Church, obliged<note n="r" place="margin">Marcel. &amp; Faustin. prefat. ad libel. precum.</note> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by oath before all the People never to admit another Bishop while <hi>Liberius</hi> liv'd; and <hi>Damasus,</hi> we are told, purpos'd to accompany <hi>Liberius</hi> into Exile; but having gone part of the journey, left him, and return'd back to <hi>Rome,</hi> where by the prevalency of the <hi>Arian</hi> faction, <hi>Faelix</hi> the Archdeacon was ordained Bishop, one otherways sound in the faith. With him the Clergy notwithstanding their former oath complied, and <hi>Damasus</hi> among the rest; though the people were generally offended at it, and refus'd to go the wonted Procession with the new-made Pope. Three years after, <hi>viz. An.</hi> CCCLVIII, <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius</hi> upon his subscribing the <hi>Arian</hi> cause, was releas'd from Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment; upon whose return <hi>Faelix</hi> was driven out of the City; and when a little after he came back, and held his Assemblies in the <hi>Julian</hi> Church beyond <hi>Tiber;</hi> the people rose up a 2d. time and thrust him out, <hi>Liberius</hi> in the mean time doing all he could to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose affairs, and to reconcile the Clergy, who had taken part with <hi>Faelix,</hi> whom he restored to their former places. <hi>Liberius</hi> surviv'd his restitution eight years, dying <hi>September</hi> the xxivth, <hi>Anno</hi> CCCLXVI.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. UPON his Decease appear'd two Competitors for the Chair, <hi>Damasus,</hi> and <hi>Ursicinus</hi> or <hi>Ursinus,</hi> a Deacon of that Church, who with some few more, had kept strictly to their engagement, and had all along refus'd to own <hi>Faelix</hi> for their Bishop. <hi>Damasus</hi> and his Party appear'd in <hi>Lucinis</hi> say mine Authors, though where that was, I am yet to seek; where they demanded him for their Bishop, and who was accordingly consecrated in the <hi>Lateran</hi> Church: while <hi>Ursicinus</hi> and his Followers made their procession in the Church of <hi>Julius,</hi> and requir'd him who had never been defiled with the <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Commuion for Bishop, and in the Church of <hi>Sicinius,</hi> or rather <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> (as <hi>Socrates</hi> tells us<note n="s" place="margin">

Marcell. lib. <hi>27.</hi>
                     </note>, factions grew high on both sides, from words they fell to blows, and thence to blood and slaughter, and nothing was seen but Swords and instruments of fury; and the holy places filled with dead or mangled Bodies. <hi>Viventius</hi> the Provost endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured what in him lay to put a stop to the torrent, but finding the stream swell'd too high, and that he was neither able to sweeten nor controul the exasperated humour, he was forced to retire out of the City for his own security. But <hi>Damasus</hi> his party, at length pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, the other being beaten out of sight, and that with so considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a loss, that only in the Church of <hi>Sisinius,</hi> there were kill'd in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49523:352"/> one day no less then CXXXVII persons; to the infinite scandal of Religion, and the resentment of all sober and good men.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. THIS is the account, bad enough at best, that's agreed on all hands: But <hi>Marcellinus</hi> and <hi>Faustinus</hi> two Presbyters, who liv'd at that time, in the preface of their Petition to the Emperor <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosius</hi> represent a much more tragical face of things, with a heavy charge upon the memory of Pope <hi>Damasus.</hi> They tell us, that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masus</hi> hearing of <hi>Ursicinus</hi> his Ordination, hired a mighty crew of Charioteers, Sword-players, and the infamous rabble, and marcht with them to the <hi>Julian</hi> Church, which they broke open and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered all they met with for three days together; and having by bribes made <hi>Viventius</hi> the Provost, and <hi>Julian</hi> Prefect of the <hi>Granary</hi> of his side, procur'd <hi>Ursicinus</hi> with <hi>Amantius</hi> and <hi>Lupus</hi> his two Deacons to be banisht, beating or killing those of the people that refused to come over to him. And understanding that the people had secur'd seven Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, and had plac't them in <hi>Liberius</hi> his Church, he came thither with his armed multitude; and <hi>October</hi> the xxvi<seg rend="sup">th</seg> beset the Church, broke open the Doors, and put fire to the place, where they were secur'd, that there might be no passage to escape, while others until'd the roof and threw down the tiles upon the people within, and then rushing in kill'd men and women to the number of CLX, wounding many more, of whom several died afterwards; while <hi>Damasus</hi> lost not one of his party: that the people earnestly petition'd God and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour (while <hi>Damasus</hi> rais'd a fresh, and as they call it, a fifth perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution against them) that the cause might be heard in a convention of Bishops, and things fairly tried; whose Petitions being presented to <hi>Valentinian,</hi> he the year following releas'd them that had been ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht: so <hi>Ursicinus</hi> and his Deacons return'd <hi>October</hi> the xvith, and were joyfully wellcom'd by their people: That <hi>Damasus</hi> having made those at Court his Friends, kept the Emperour from being acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the true state of things, who accordingly commands that <hi>Ursicinus</hi> should create no farther trouble; and he now finding that no good was to be done, for peace sake surrendred himself to the mercy of his Enemies, and by order from the Emperor on the xviith of <hi>December</hi> went again and into banishment, after whose departure his people de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute of all their Ministers kept their stations in the <hi>Caemiteries</hi> of the Martyrs; and being assembled on a time in S. <hi>Agnes</hi> Church, were again set upon by <hi>Damasus,</hi> who slew many of them. After which he invited the Neighbour Bishops of <hi>Italy</hi> (as the custom was) to so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnize his Birth-day, whom he endeavour'd to perswade to joyn with him in the condemnation of <hi>Ursicinus,</hi> but receiv'd no other answer, then that they came to celebrate his nativity, not to condemn a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son unheard, and before they knew what he had to say for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. THIS is the sum of that account, which those two Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters give of this matter. They were 'tis true of the <hi>Luciferian</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, that is, those that rejected all communion with any that had communicated with the <hi>Arians;</hi> which perhaps might make them write a little more tartly. But whether this be sufficient to destroy their evidence, and enervate the force of their testimony in matters of fact within their knowledge, is left to the Reader to judge: if so, 'twill be some abatement to S. <hi>Jerom</hi>'s testimony (upon which <hi>Baronius</hi> lays
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49523:353"/> so much stress, though he says nothing very material to the purpose) his dear friendship and kindness to Pope <hi>Damasus</hi> bringing him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the suspition of partiality. To me it seems scarce credible that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of their character in so solemn an address to the Emperor should usher it in with nothing but pure lies and falsehoods; and those too gross and palbable, the things done being still fresh in memory, and <hi>Damasus</hi> himself yet alive. And methinks what pains soever <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> takes to put a gloss upon the Story, it looks a little odd, the account which their own <hi>Pontifical</hi> Book<note n="u" place="margin">In vit. Damas. Con. cil. T. <hi>11.</hi> col. <hi>859.</hi>
                     </note> gives of this affair, that <hi>Damasus</hi> was constituted Bishop, because he had the greater and the stronger party. But let the Reader weigh the whole matter in an impartial ballance, and then incline to which side he please. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that what ever irregularities might happen in <hi>Damasus</hi> his election; or what ill things he or his party might be guilty of, he sufficiently recovered his credit, and for his prudence piety and zeal against <hi>Arianism</hi> purchas'd a great and just reverence throughout the whole Christian World.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. BEING at length setled and confirm'd, he began to act in his public station. About the year CCCLXIX, he conven'd a Synod, whereat met ninety Bishops out of <hi>Italy</hi> and some parts of <hi>France;</hi> who considering how much the <hi>Arian</hi> Artifices still prevail'd, and how many were mislead by false apprehensions and misrepresentations of things, condemn'd the transactions of the Council of <hi>Ariminum,</hi> and particularly <hi>Auxentius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Milan,</hi> the great stickler for <hi>Arianism</hi> in those parts, confirm'd and reinforc't the <hi>Nicaene</hi> faith, an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of all which Pope <hi>Damasus</hi> and the rest gave in a Synodical E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle<note n="w" place="margin">Ext. ap. Theod. l. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>22.</hi> p. <hi>102.</hi>
                     </note> to the Bishops of <hi>Illyricum,</hi> wherein they recommend the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic Doctrine, and what they had done in it to them, and to desire them by an answer to signify their consent and concurrence with them. Sad in the mean time was the case of the Catholics in the <hi>Eastern</hi> Church, where by the favour and passionate concernment of the Emperor <hi>Valens,</hi> the <hi>Arians</hi> bore all the sway, and almost in every place carried all before them. Of which S. <hi>Basil</hi> makes a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable representation in his Epistles, who wrote likewise, and sent Legats to <hi>Damasus</hi> and the <hi>Western</hi> Bishops to implore their aid and help in this common cause. And to speed more effectually, he engag'd the great <hi>Athanasius</hi> (whose authority was then enough to give reputation to any request) to write to <hi>Damasus</hi> in their behalf. But whatever answer <hi>Damasus</hi> return'd (for his Letters are not now extant) 'tis plain he was very cold and indifferent in this affair; as appears from the many complaints and sometimes tart reflections which <hi>Basil</hi> makes upon this occasion, as elsewhere we have related more at large.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. BUT the Catholic interest in the <hi>East</hi> did not only suffer from the malice and cruelty of the <hi>Arians,</hi> but from their intestine quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels and divisions among themselves; as appear'd especially in the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> where <hi>besides</hi> Eudoxius the <hi>Arian</hi> Bishop, and <hi>Vitalis</hi> the Lay-Ringleader of the <hi>Apollinarian</hi> party there were <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letius</hi> and <hi>Paulinus</hi> both Catholic Prelates in that Church, some ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king part with the one, and some with the other; and the Church by this means rent asunder into a miserable schism. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masus</hi> espous'd the cause of <hi>Paulinus,</hi> who had been consecrated by
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49523:353"/>
                     <hi>Lucifer Calaritanus</hi> a Western Bishop: and when S. <hi>Jerom</hi> then resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at <hi>Antioch</hi> knew not well whom to joyn with, he sent to <hi>Rome</hi> to consult with Pope <hi>Damasus,</hi> who advised him to hold communion with <hi>Paulinus:</hi> Nay after the death of <hi>Meletius,</hi> and that another was chosen in his room, he still persistted in abetting and patronizing <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus,</hi> thereby giving no little life to the pernicious divisions of that Church. About the year CCCLXXIII. (if <hi>Baronius</hi>
                     <note n="x" place="margin">Baron. eod. An.</note> compute it right) a Synod was holden at <hi>Rome,</hi> whereat was present <hi>Peter</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> Successor to <hi>Athanasius,</hi> who forc'd away by the barbarous cruelties of the <hi>Arians,</hi> had fled hither for shelter. The chief thing transacted in this Synod, was the condemnation of the <hi>Apollinarian</hi> heresy, then newly sprung up in the World, asserting our Lord to have assum'd human flesh without any rational mind or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, his Deity supplying the room of that: <hi>Apollinaris</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, together with his prime disciple <hi>Timotheus</hi> being depos'd and censur'd. <hi>Vitalis</hi> the head of that Sect at <hi>Antioch</hi> (though a Lay-man, as the <hi>Alexandrian Chronicon</hi>
                     <note n="y" place="margin">Ad An. Julian, <hi>1.</hi> p. <hi>688.</hi>
                     </note> assures us, and that his Followers were call'd the Sect of the <hi>Vitalians</hi>) was at this time at <hi>Rome;</hi> where he solemnly retracted and abjur'd his errors before the Council, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd the Catholic faith, and was receiv'd to Communion, and by him <hi>Damasus</hi> wrote to <hi>Paulinus,</hi> referring the man to him for a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trial and discussion of his case. Of the proceedings of this Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod in the cause of <hi>Apollinaris, Damasus</hi> afterwards wrote<note n="z" place="margin">Ext.

                     </note> an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to the <hi>Eastern</hi> Bishops, who it seems had desired his concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the deposition of <hi>Timotheus,</hi> which he certifies them he had synodically done some time before. At the same time, and by assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the same Synod, he publisht a large confession of faith<note n="a" place="margin">Ext. ib. c. <hi>11.</hi> p. <hi>213. &amp;c.</hi>
                     </note>, wherein he denounces particular <hi>anathema's</hi> against all the heretical <hi>Dogmata</hi> of every Sect, which then infested the Church, and spake Defiance to the Faith of <hi>Nice;</hi> and this he directed to <hi>Paulinus</hi> (no doubt him of <hi>Antioch</hi>) then lying at <hi>Thessalonica</hi> in <hi>Macedonia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">VII. THE distracted state of the Church, and the care and piety of the good Emperour <hi>Theodosius,</hi> brought together the great Synod at <hi>Constantinople, An.</hi> CCCLXXXI, which ever had the title and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of a General Council; though Pope <hi>Damasus</hi> was neither him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, nor by his Legats present there. However <hi>Baronius</hi>
                     <note n="b" place="margin">Ad An. <hi>381.</hi>
                     </note> according to his custom to secure the Papal prorogative, would perswade us that <hi>Damasus</hi> afterwards confirm'd this Council; but withall is forc'd to strain so hard for a trifling pretence or two to give colour to it, that any man may plainly see 'tis more than the cause will naturally bear. Though if he had confirm'd it, this had implied no superiority, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation in this sence signifying no more than a consent and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, a thing usually done by all Bishops, but especially those of the greater Sees. In the third Canon of this Council, the Fathers advanc'd the Bishopric of <hi>Constantinople</hi> to the next degree of honour and priveledge to the <hi>Roman</hi> See. This vext them at <hi>Rome,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the next year to chastise the folly and presumption of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil (as <hi>Baronius</hi> speaks<note n="c" place="margin">Ad An. <hi>382.</hi>
                     </note>) <hi>Damasus</hi> in a Synod at <hi>Rome</hi> made a Canon, extant in the <hi>Cresconian</hi> Collection, wherein having briefly prefac'd something concerning the Prerogative of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> he adjusts the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedence and priviledges of the three great Sees, giving the first place to that of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> or the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, <hi>that has neither spot nor

But the mischief is, what ever <hi>Cresconius</hi> pleasantly dreamt of, <hi>Damasus</hi> and his Council past no such Canon, and therefore the last Publishers of the Councils wisely refer it to the <hi>Roman</hi> Synod held many years after under Pope <hi>Gelasius, An.</hi> CCCCLXIV. But to proceed with the <hi>Constantinopolitan</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; in the fifth Canon the Synod agrees to receive all those at <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> that confess'd the Deity of all the three Persons of the Trinity, according to the <gap reason="foreign">

In the same Letter he desir'd the <hi>Eastern</hi> Bishops to come to a general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil at <hi>Rome</hi> (about which it seems he had been dealing with the Emperor) especially to adjust and decide the case of the See of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> still as much divided as ever, between <hi>Paulinus,</hi> and <hi>Flavian, Meletius</hi> his Successor, whose election had been ratified by the <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinopolitan</hi> Synod the year before. To this Epistle the Fathers (many of whom met again at <hi>Constantinople</hi> the next year) return'd an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer; as for the journey to <hi>Rome,</hi> they excus'd themselves; as for the faith, they agreed with him; and for other proceedings, they gave him an account of what they had done both in the business of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and in that of other Sees.</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. IT was not long that <hi>Damasus</hi> liv'd after this.

As for the miracles reported to have been done by him, they that can believe the Acts of <hi>Damasus,</hi> may find them there. The works of Magnificence attributed to him by the Writers of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, are two Churches, one near <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Theater, the other in the <hi>Via Ardeatina,</hi> where he was buried in the <hi>Catacumbae</hi> near the bodies of S. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> the floar whereof he had beautified with a Pavement of variegated Marble. He diligently sought out the graves of many Martyrs, whose
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:49523:354"/> Tombs he adorn'd with suitable Epitaphs, enobled the Church of S. <hi>Laurentius,</hi> and enrich'd it with many exquisit and costly gifts, and hither his body was translated from the place of its first interment. In his life time he held an intimate correspondence with S. <hi>Jerom;</hi> whom he oft consulted about the sence of obscure and difficult pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture; S. <hi>Jeroms</hi> great skill in <hi>Hebrew</hi> enabling him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn very satisfactory resolutions. What his parts and learning were, we can make no certain guess, little of his being extant. His Tracts <hi>de Virginitate,</hi> both in Prose and Verse (mentioned by S. <hi>Jerom</hi>

After whose departure came several Bishops into the Church, with an intention to have proceeded to his Consecration; but he told them, they might spare their pains, for the Angels had already done that office for him. Whereat as we may suppose, they were greatly astonisht, and having given him the peace, went their way. This is the sum of the idle Story of his Ordination, for I would not abuse the Readers patience to set it down at large.

                     </note> to <hi>Abyrtius</hi> in his behalf, as well as by his own complaints, it appears, that he met with very hard usage, was toss'd and hurried up and down, heavily fin'd, and expos'd to the rage and petulancy of the people, all which fell the heavier upon him, as being both unus'd to trouble, and naturally unapt to bear it. In this condition he remain'd for seven or eight years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, comforted by his Friends, and especially by the Letters<note n="f" place="margin">Vid. Naz.

Having dispatch'd the Affairs of the <hi>Arabian</hi> Churches, he resolv'd for <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> having engag'd to confer with the Bishops of those Parts, and to assist in their Reformation.

This soon gave him enough of that place, and with an heavy heart he return'd to the Metropolis, (I suppose he means <hi>Antioch,</hi> the Metropolis of the <hi>East,</hi> where he met<note n="k" place="margin">De vit. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crin init.</note> with <hi>Olympius</hi> the Monk, then going to visit the Holy places at <hi>Jerusalem</hi>) whence he wrote back to the three Ladies at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> to let them know his sence of things, and to caution them not to be seduc'd by those that sought to make a prey of them. Upon occasion of this Journey he was afterwards consulted<note n="l" place="margin">Vid. Epist. de cunt. Hieros. in init.</note> by a Friend, whether (what it seems was the opinion of some monastic Disciplinarians of that time) it was any essential part of Religion to make Pilgrimages to <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> In answer whereunto he freely declares himself in the Negative, that our Lord had not by any Precept bound this Duty upon us, nor made it any of the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary qualifications to Eternal Salvation, that such Journeys could not be accomplish'd without manifest inconveniencies both to the Body and the Soul, that the grace of God and his favour were not confin'd to <hi>Golgotha</hi> or Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> or our Lord now corporally present in those places; that they had more reason to expect his Spirit in <hi>Cappa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docia,</hi> where God was more frequently and sincerely worship'd, than at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> where all sorts of Vices and Immoralities did so much abound; that if he himself had been there, it was not so much to gratifie himself, as to comply with the necessities of the Church, he being sufficiently satisfied in the truth of our Lord's Life and Death before ever he saw <hi>Bethlehem</hi> or <hi>Calvary,</hi> and this was the only advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage he had reap'd, to find that Piety flourish'd much more at home; that 'tis not the change of places makes us nearer to Heaven, but where-ever we are, God will come to us, if the Soul be but a fit Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation for God to dwell in; but if it be defil'd with Lust and Sin, tho thou should'st dwell at <hi>Golgotha,</hi> or upon the Mount of <hi>Olaves,</hi> thou would'st be as far from his Presence and Company, as if thou hadst never once heard of him. A Discourse that so mortally wounds the Doctrine and Practice of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in point of Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, that after all their vain attempts to evade the blow, they are forc'd to run away, and give up the Cause. But my business now is not to insist upon that. Being return'd home, he went to visit his dear Sister <hi>Macrina,</hi> whom by reason of his Troubles he had not seen of many years. His visit was most opportune, for he found her in a dying condition, he pray'd with her, bless'd her, and assisted her in her last hours, and saw her decently brought to her Grave: All which
